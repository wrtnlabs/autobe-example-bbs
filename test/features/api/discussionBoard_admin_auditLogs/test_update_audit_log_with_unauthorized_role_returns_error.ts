/**
 * Validate that audit log update is forbidden to non-admin users.
 *
 * This test confirms that a user without admin rights cannot update a
 * discussion board audit log entry via the admin API endpoint, ensuring proper
 * role-based access control enforcement.
 *
 * Business Context: Only administrators are permitted to update audit log
 * records for compliance and security purposes. Regular users should receive an
 * authorization error (not found or forbidden) when attempting such actions
 * directly, thus validating protection against privilege escalation or
 * accidental misuse.
 *
 * Step-by-step process:
 *
 * 1. As an admin, create an audit log record to supply a valid auditLogId for
 *    later update attempts.
 * 2. Simulate login/session for a non-admin (e.g., regular user, guest, or user
 *    with insufficient role). (In the absence of concrete authentication APIs
 *    from the materials, simulate the switch by clearing/removing admin tokens
 *    or state if possible, or skip explicit login calls.)
 * 3. Attempt to update the audit log using the auditLogId as a non-admin.
 * 4. Verify that access is denied by capturing and asserting error throw,
 *    confirming that audit log modification is prohibited for non-admin users.
