/**
 * Test that a non-moderator, non-admin user cannot delete a content flag
 * (authorization enforcement).
 *
 * This test simulates a typical moderator workflow up to the creation of a
 * content flag, then switches roles to a normal user to attempt a forbidden
 * operation. It validates strict access control logic for flag deletion.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. As ADMIN: Register a normal member user (that lacks moderator or admin
 *    privileges).
 * 2. As MEMBER: (For post association) Create a post in a random thread.
 * 3. As MODERATOR (assume already authenticated): Create a content flag on the
 *    post.
 * 4. As MEMBER: Attempt to delete the flag with the non-privileged user â€” expect
 *    an authorization error.
 * 5. As MODERATOR: Ensure the flag is still present (cannot verify by a GET since
 *    no such endpoint is provided, but indirect verification can be discussed
 *    in comments).
 *
 * Only uses actual DTOs and API functions provided; login/auth flows with
 * role/context switching are not available directly in this API set, so we
 * perform calls in sequence according to requirements.
