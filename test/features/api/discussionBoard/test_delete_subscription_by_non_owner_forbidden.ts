/**
 * Validate forbidden deletion of another member's subscription.
 *
 * This test checks that only the owner of a subscription is permitted to delete it, upholding privacy and access control policies.
 *
 * Step-by-step:
 * 1. Register two member accounts (owner and non-owner).
 * 2. As the owner, create a subscription entity with a random target.
 * 3. Switch to the non-owner user.
 * 4. Attempt to delete the owner's subscription. This should result in a forbidden (403) error.
 * 5. Confirm the subscription entity persists (not deleted) by re-authenticating as the owner and verifying its existence if an endpoint allows it.
 *
 * This test validates failure on cross-user deletion attempts and enforces privacy/security.
