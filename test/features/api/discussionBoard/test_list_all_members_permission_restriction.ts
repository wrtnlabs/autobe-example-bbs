/**
 * Validate that non-admin users are forbidden from accessing the board member
 * list.
 *
 * This test verifies the access control on the admin board member listing
 * endpoint. It ensures that users without admin privileges cannot retrieve the
 * list of all board members, and that an appropriate authorization error is
 * thrown when access is attempted.
 *
 * Test steps:
 *
 * 1. Create a regular (non-admin) member using the admin/member creation endpoint
 *    â€” as no explicit non-admin authentication APIs are available, the member
 *    is created for completeness.
 * 2. Attempt to retrieve the admin-only members list using a connection presumed
 *    to lack admin privileges.
 * 3. Assert that an access/authorization error is thrown and access is denied to
 *    non-admins.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * - As no authentication or user role switching SDKs are provided, the test
 *   assumes that the given connection is not privileged as admin for the list
 *   access attempt. Only available SDKs and DTOs are used.
 * - Error assertion does not check message/type specifics; it only validates that
 *   an error occurs on forbidden access.
