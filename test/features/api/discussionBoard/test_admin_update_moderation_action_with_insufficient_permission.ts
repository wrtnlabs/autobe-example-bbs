/**
 * Validate enforcement of permissions when attempting to update moderation
 * actions.
 *
 * This test ensures that only admin- or moderator-privileged users can update
 * moderation action records. Attempting to update as a regular member (who
 * lacks admin/mod privilege) must fail with an authorization error. This
 * enforces both backend access policies and prevents privilege escalation or
 * unauthorized moderation action modification.
 *
 * Workflow:
 *
 * 1. Admin creates a regular discussion board member. This represents a regular
 *    user.
 * 2. Admin creates a moderation action (with self as the actor) to set up a record
 *    for testing.
 * 3. (SDK limitation): It is not possible to simulate a non-admin/non-moderator
 *    user context, as there are no available authentication or authorization
 *    endpoints for doing so. Therefore, this negative path cannot be tested
 *    beyond documentation/acknowledgment.
