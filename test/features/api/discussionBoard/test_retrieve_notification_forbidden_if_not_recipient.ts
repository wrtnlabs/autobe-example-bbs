/**
 * Test that a notification cannot be retrieved by a user who is not its intended recipient.
 *
 * This scenario validates privacy and access control of the notification retrieval endpoint. It ensures no member can view notifications addressed to another account.
 *
 * Workflow:
 * 1. Register User A (recipient)
 * 2. Register User B (unauthorized actor)
 * 3. While authenticated as User A, create a notification with User A as the recipient
 * 4. While authenticated as User B, attempt to retrieve the notification using its ID
 * 5. Expect a forbidden or not found error response (privacy rules enforced)
 *
 * Steps confirm that only the recipient may access their own notification details, and others cannot view themâ€”even if having the notification's UUID.
