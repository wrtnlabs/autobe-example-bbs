/**
 * Validate that only admin users can access the report listing endpoint;
 * non-admin users must be forbidden.
 *
 * This test verifies that the GET /discussionBoard/admin/reports endpoint
 * cannot be accessed by ordinary members (non-admins) or unauthenticated
 * guests, thus enforcing privilege boundaries and preventing sensitive data
 * leakage.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. As admin, create a regular board member (to have a valid non-admin user for
 *    testing).
 * 2. Simulate non-admin authentication context (regular member) and attempt to
 *    access /discussionBoard/admin/reports.
 *
 *    - Expectation: The request must fail with a forbidden error (HTTP 403 or
 *         similar), with no paged data structure or report information
 *         returned.
 * 3. Optionally, attempt access as an unauthenticated guest (no login) and verify
 *    that access is denied in the same way.
 * 4. Confirm that no information about reports is leaked under any unauthorized
 *    attempt.
 *
 * Note: Due to limitations in the provided SDK/API (lack of explicit login or
 * context-switching functions), this test assumes persistence of admin context
 * for all API calls. In a real test suite, user context switching for
 * member/guest would be performed by re-authenticating or manipulating session
 * tokens. Here, we verify the forbidden-access logic as far as feasible.
