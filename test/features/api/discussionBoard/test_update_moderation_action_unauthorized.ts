/**
 * Test unauthorized user cannot update moderation action.
 *
 * This test ensures that only moderator or admin accounts can update moderation
 * action records. Verifies that a regular (non-moderator, non-admin) user is
 * denied when attempting to perform a moderation action update, and that the
 * moderation action itself is not changed as a result of the unauthorized
 * attempt.
 *
 * Test Steps:
 *
 * 1. (Admin) Create a new member (non-moderator, non-admin)
 * 2. (Admin) Create a new moderation action attached to a random (real or mock)
 *    target
 * 3. Attempt to update the moderation action as the non-privileged user
 *
 *    - Confirm the request fails (authorization error)
 *    - Confirm that the moderation action was not changed
