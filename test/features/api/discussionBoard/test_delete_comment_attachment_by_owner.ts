/**
 * Validate that a member can delete their own comment attachment.
 *
 * This test covers the workflow where a registered board member uploads and
 * then deletes their own comment attachment. It verifies:
 *
 * 1. A member can create a comment and upload an attachment to it as the
 *    owner/uploader.
 * 2. The member can successfully delete that attachment via the accordance API.
 * 3. Once deleted, further attempts to delete the same attachment result in an
 *    error â€“ demonstrating it is removed from the system and cannot be
 *    retrieved.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Register a new discussion board member (admin-only route).
 * 2. As this member, create a comment on a (simulated) post.
 * 3. Upload a file attachment to the newly created comment, as the
 *    member/uploader.
 * 4. Delete that same attachment as the owner.
 * 5. Attempt to re-delete to confirm effective removal.
