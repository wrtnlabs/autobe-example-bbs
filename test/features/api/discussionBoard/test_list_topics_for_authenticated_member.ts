/**
 * Validate topic list retrieval for an authenticated member compared to a
 * guest.
 *
 * This test checks whether logging in as a member changes the topics visible in
 * the paginated list. It confirms correct access controls and that regular
 * members are not granted access to hidden or restricted topics. Depending on
 * requirements, it also validates whether the response is identical for guests
 * and members, or whether member-only topics appear (if such functionality
 * exists).
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Retrieve discussion board topic list as a guest.
 * 2. (If authentication API is available) Log in as a regular member.
 * 3. Retrieve the same discussion board topic list as an authenticated member.
 * 4. Compare results. Confirm public topics are always visible to both. If system
 *    includes member-only topics, ensure only those are extra for the member;
 *    otherwise, verify results are identical.
 * 5. Confirm pagination structure and topic access controls.
