/**
 * Test forbidden access to comment attachment detail for unauthorized roles.
 *
 * This test validates that only authorized users (moderators or the resource
 * owner) may access attachment metadata for a comment, and other users
 * (non-owners, other members, or guests) must be denied.
 *
 * Business context: Attachments may contain sensitive/private data, so strict
 * role-based access control (RBAC) is required. This test ensures RBAC is
 * correctly enforced by the read-detail moderator endpoint, protecting private
 * files from non-authorized access.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Register board member A, who becomes the owner/uploader of an attachment.
 * 2. Board member A creates a comment.
 * 3. Board member A uploads an attachment to the comment.
 * 4. Register another board member B (simulating an unrelated userâ€”not owner,
 *    moderator, or staff).
 * 5. Attempt to view the attachment's detail via the moderator endpoint as board
 *    member B: expect error (forbidden).
 * 6. Optionally, validate a similar error occurs for a "guest" (if unauthenticated
 *    context is possible with the API as implemented).
 *
 * This scenario enforces correct negative access for both member and guest (to
 * the extent allowed by the available authentication APIs).
