/**
 * Validate that guest (unauthenticated) users cannot access member subscription
 * listings.
 *
 * Business context: Access to member subscription lists in the discussion board
 * must be restricted to authenticated users only, as the subscriptions are tied
 * to user identities and may contain sensitive information about member
 * interests. Guests (unauthenticated users) must not be permitted to view
 * anyone's subscriptions, whether or not any actually exist in the system.
 *
 * Test Steps:
 *
 * 1. Ensure connection is in a guest/unauthenticated state (do not perform
 *    authentication prior to API call)
 * 2. Attempt to retrieve the member subscriptions listing using the GET
 *    /discussionBoard/member/subscriptions endpoint
 * 3. Validate that a forbidden error (e.g., HTTP 401 or 403) is thrown, confirming
 *    guests are blocked from accessing subscriptions
 * 4. (Edge case) The test should succeed whether or not subscriptions exist for
 *    any user (i.e., this is an auth check, not a data existence check)
