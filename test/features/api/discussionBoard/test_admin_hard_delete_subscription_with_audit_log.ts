/**
 * Validates that an admin can permanently delete (hard delete) a user's
 * discussion board subscription by its unique ID.
 *
 * This test ensures:
 *
 * - Subscriptions are actually removed and cannot be retrieved post-deletion (no
 *   soft delete semantics)
 * - Required admin permissions are respected
 * - Audit requirements can be supported externally (not directly checked here)
 *
 * Workflow:
 *
 * 1. Create a new member (representing the user to have a subscription).
 * 2. Create a new board subscription as an admin, using the new member as
 *    subscriber.
 * 3. Hard-delete (erase) the subscription by its ID using the admin API.
 * 4. Try to delete it again (should not find resource).
 * 5. (Optional: If listing/retrieval existed, verify subscription absence).
 *
 * Note: No direct subscription GET/listing endpoint is present in available API
 * functions for final validationâ€”hard delete implies absence.
