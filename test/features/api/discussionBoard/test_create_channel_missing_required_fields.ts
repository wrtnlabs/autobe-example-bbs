/**
 * Test creation of a channel with missing required fields (code or name) and expect validation errors.
 *
 * This scenario attempts to validate backend enforcement of required fields ('code', 'name') during
 * channel creation. However, as both fields are required at the TypeScript DTO level, omitting them
 * is not possible in type-safe code. Such tests would require intentionally breaking the type system
 * (e.g., via 'as any'), which is strictly forbidden by project standards. Therefore, no E2E test can
 * be implemented for this scenario within type-safe constraints. This scenario should be covered by DTO
 * type validation tests at the compile or schema level instead.

// Skipped: Cannot test backend validation of missing required fields via E2E with type safety. All channel creation requests must include both 'code' and 'name' by TypeScript type constraints.
