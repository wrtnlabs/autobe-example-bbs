/**
 * Validates that a moderator can delete any attachment from any user's post.
 *
 * This test covers the full flow: creating a topic, then a thread, a post, and
 * uploading an attachment as a member. It then switches to moderator role to
 * delete the uploaded attachment and checks that the attachment is no longer
 * retrievable.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Create a new topic (as member)
 * 2. Create a thread under the topic (as member)
 * 3. Create a post in the thread (as member)
 * 4. Upload an attachment to the post (as member)
 * 5. As moderator, delete the attachment from the post
 * 6. Verify the attachment is deleted and cannot be retrieved
