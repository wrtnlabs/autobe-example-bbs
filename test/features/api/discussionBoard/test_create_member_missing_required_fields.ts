/**
 * Test member creation API with missing required fields.
 *
 * This scenario would ensure the API returns validation errors when
 * 'user_identifier' or 'joined_at' are missing. However, because TypeScript
 * enforces required properties and forbids passing incomplete objects (and all
 * type safety bypasses like `as any` or `satisfies any` are forbidden), we
 * **cannot** implement a runtime test that omits required properties without
 * breaking type safety.
 *
 * Per test generation policy, negative tests that require intentionally
 * omitting required fields (causing compilation or type-check errors) are not
 * implementable in a type-safe manner; thus this test is intentionally
 * omitted.
