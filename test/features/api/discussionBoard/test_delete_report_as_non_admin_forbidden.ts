/**
 * Validate that only admins can delete discussion board reportsâ€”non-admin users
 * must receive a forbidden error.
 *
 * Business purpose:
 *
 * - Ensures that report deletion (a destructive/sensitive moderation action) is
 *   strictly restricted to admin roles per business rules and compliance/audit
 *   requirements.
 * - Verifies that no member or moderator can bypass privilege boundaries to erase
 *   reports, preserving evidence and moderation integrity.
 *
 * Test Workflow:
 *
 * 1. Create a report as a normal (non-admin) member.
 * 2. Attempt to delete the report via the admin-only endpoint with a non-admin
 *    session.
 * 3. Confirm the system throws a forbidden error (privilege escalation is
 *    blocked).
