/**
 * Validate that the admin member search endpoint handles invalid and degenerate
 * filters robustly.
 *
 * This test attempts to search with a legitimately constructed filter that
 * yields zero results (e.g., a user_identifier not present in the DB),
 * demonstrating that the API returns a valid, empty result set and does not
 * crash or expose sensitive error details.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Attempt to perform an advanced member search using a filter body with a
 *    user_identifier that is extremely unlikely to exist.
 * 2. Confirm that the API responds successfully with an empty result array, not an
 *    error or crash.
 * 3. Document that it is not possible, via TypeScript, to send requests with
 *    malformed types or non-existent properties -- such errors are prevented at
 *    compile time and cannot be tested via E2E.
