/**
 * Validate that an admin user can successfully delete a thread from a topic and
 * confirm permanent removal.
 *
 * Business context:
 *
 * - Only admins (or moderators) can delete threads. Deletion is permanent and
 *   cascades to all posts under the thread. This ensures the moderation
 *   integrity of the discussion board platform.
 *
 * Test Workflow:
 *
 * 1. Create a discussion topic as an admin user.
 * 2. Create a thread in the topic as admin.
 * 3. Delete the thread via admin endpoint.
 * 4. Attempt to delete the same thread again; expect an error (thread should no
 *    longer exist).
 * 5. All steps use type-safe data and validate contract compliance.
