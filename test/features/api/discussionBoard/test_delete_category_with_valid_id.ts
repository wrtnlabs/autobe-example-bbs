/**
 * Validate soft-deletion of a discussion board category via the DELETE endpoint.
 *
 * This test ensures that deleting (soft-deleting) a category sets its deleted_at timestamp
 * and that double-deletion triggers an error. Category soft-deletion is crucial for audit
 * trails and reversible admin workflows, as per compliance and business requirements.
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1. Create a new, unique discussion board category as a test fixture.
 * 2. Soft-delete the just-created category using DELETE /discussionBoard/categories/{id}.
 * 3. Validate that the returned deleted category's deleted_at is set (not null).
 * 4. Attempt to delete the same category againâ€”expect an error.
 * 5. (Category listings/exclusion check skipped since no list/get endpoint in supplied SDK.)
