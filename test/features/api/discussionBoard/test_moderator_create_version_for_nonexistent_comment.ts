/**
 * Validates moderator error handling when creating a comment version for a
 * non-existent comment.
 *
 * This test ensures that when a moderator attempts to create (append) a new
 * version of a comment using a validly formatted but non-existent commentId,
 * the API responds with an appropriate error (typically a not found). This
 * prevents audit/version tables from including orphaned records and enforces
 * strict referential integrity. It also verifies proper error signaling for
 * moderation workflows involving missing or deleted entities.
 *
 * Test Workflow:
 *
 * 1. Create a new board member via the admin endpoint (who will act as the
 *    editor/moderator).
 * 2. Attempt to create a comment version as a moderator with a random UUID as
 *    commentId that does NOT exist.
 * 3. Confirm that the API correctly rejects the request (error is thrown), as
 *    expected.
 *
 * Edge Cases Considered:
 *
 * - Valid UUID that has never been associated with a comment
 * - Ensures error is properly thrown (not swallowed), but does not inspect error
 *   message/details
 *
 * Only business-implementable (runtime) validation is performed â€“ it does not
 * attempt type system or invalid DTO structure errors.
