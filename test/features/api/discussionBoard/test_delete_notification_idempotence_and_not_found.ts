/**
 * Validate idempotence and not-found behavior for deleting discussion board notifications.
 *
 * This test ensures:
 * 1. Deleting an existing notification by ID succeeds (soft-deletes and returns correct data).
 * 2. Attempting to delete the same notification a second time (when it's already soft-deleted) results in an error.
 * 3. Attempting to delete a notification with a random non-existent ID also results in an error.
 *
 * Business context: Notification deletions must be safe and idempotent. The back-end must return clear error conditions and never succeed in "re-deleting" already deleted items. This is critical for proper UI and audit handling.
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1. Register a discussion board member (who will receive the notification).
 * 2. Create a notification for this member.
 * 3. Delete the notification by ID (expect soft-delete success).
 * 4. Immediately repeat the delete call with the same ID (expect error: not found).
 * 5. Attempt deletion for a random non-existent notification UUID (expect error: not found).
