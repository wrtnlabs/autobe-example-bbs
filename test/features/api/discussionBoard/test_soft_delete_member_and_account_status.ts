/**
 * Test soft-deleting a member by UUID and validating account status.
 *
 * This test simulates the end-to-end workflow of soft-deleting a discussion board member as an administrator:
 * - Registers a new member account
 * - Soft-deletes the member using the provided UUID via admin endpoint
 * - Verifies that preconditions (not deleted, active) were met
 * - Validates that deletion for already-deleted and non-existent members returns errors
 *
 * Coverage:
 * 1. Registers a new discussion board member
 * 2. Validates preconditions (deleted_at=null, is_active=true)
 * 3. Soft-deletes (eraseById) the member by id
 * 4. Re-attempts delete for already-deleted member (error expected)
 * 5. Attempts delete for non-existent UUID (error expected)
 *
 * Due to provided SDK constraints, post-delete state can only be validated via typing/assertion,
 * not re-retrieval/listings/logins. Any moderation role or audit fields are not directly inspectable here.
 *
 * Future enhancement: If listing/detail endpoints are added, test must query post-deletion state.
