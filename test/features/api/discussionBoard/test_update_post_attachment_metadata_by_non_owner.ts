/**
 * Test that updating a post attachment's metadata is denied when the acting
 * user did not upload the attachment (authorization test).
 *
 * This scenario verifies that only the original uploader of an attachment (or
 * privileged users) can modify attachment metadata. It prevents members from
 * tampering with attachments belonging to other users.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Member A creates a post in a thread.
 * 2. Member A uploads an attachment to that post.
 * 3. Member B (a separate member) attempts to update the metadata of that
 *    attachment (e.g., file_name).
 * 4. The update must be denied (an error thrown due to authorization failure).
 *
 * This ensures robust access control and prevents unauthorized updates to
 * attachments by non-owners.
