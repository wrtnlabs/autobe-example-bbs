/**
 * Test that access to the moderation action API is forbidden to unauthorized
 * users (guests or ordinary members).
 *
 * This test ensures that only privileged accounts (moderator or admin) may
 * create moderation actions. An ordinary member attempts to access the endpoint
 * and should be denied.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Register a regular discussion board member (not an admin or moderator).
 * 2. Attempt to create a moderation action while authenticated (or as guest if
 *    feasible), using valid-looking data but without any admin/moderator
 *    privileges.
 * 3. Confirm that the API denies the request (throws error, e.g. access
 *    denied/forbidden), and no moderation action is created.
