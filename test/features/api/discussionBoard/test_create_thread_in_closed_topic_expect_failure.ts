/**
 * Validate thread creation restriction when topic is closed.
 *
 * This test ensures that the system enforces the business rule: threads cannot
 * be created under a topic that is marked as "closed." The flow simulates an
 * admin performing all required actions.
 *
 * Step-by-step process:
 *
 * 1. Create an admin member (to act as both topic and thread creator).
 * 2. As admin, create a topic (with closed: false).
 * 3. Update that topic, setting its `closed` flag to true.
 * 4. Attempt to create a thread under the now-closed topic â€” expect this to fail
 *    (business logic error).
 * 5. Assert that the failure is due to violation of the "cannot create thread in
 *    closed topic" rule.
