/**
 * Validates that a member cannot access another user's subscription details.
 *
 * This test simulates two distinct discussion board members. The first member
 * creates a subscription entry for a topic or thread. The second member then
 * attempts to access the subscription detail belonging to the first member. The
 * system is expected to forbid this action and return an access error (such as
 * 403 Forbidden).
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Register the first discussion board member (user1) as an admin operation.
 * 2. Register a second discussion board member (user2).
 * 3. As user1, create a subscription entry to a random topic/thread.
 * 4. As user2, attempt to retrieve the subscription created by user1. Validate
 *    that the action is denied.
 *
 * This test ensures member-level access control is enforced; members cannot
 * view other users' subscription information.
