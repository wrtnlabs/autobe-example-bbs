/**
 * Validate the hard deletion workflow for a discussion board admin using a
 * valid adminId.
 *
 * This test ensures that when a valid admin user is deleted through the DELETE
 * endpoint, the admin record is removed from the system, privileges are
 * revoked, accessing the resource yields a not-found error, and the audit log
 * (if available) records the action.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Create a new admin by calling the POST /discussionBoard/admin/admins
 *    endpoint. Capture the full returned record including its UUID (admin id).
 * 2. Delete the admin by calling DELETE /discussionBoard/admin/admins/{adminId}
 *    with the returned id. Ensure the API returns a 204 No Content response as
 *    per contract.
 * 3. Attempt to GET or otherwise access the deleted admin by its id (skip this if
 *    there is no GET endpoint - explain). Confirm that a 404 Not Found error is
 *    returned, verifying deletion.
 * 4. (If possible) Confirm that privileges associated with the user_identifier are
 *    revoked immediately (this may be validated by reviewing the deleted admin
 *    recordâ€™s revoked_at field, if accessible, or by absence from any listing
 *    endpoint).
 * 5. (If audit logging is externally verifiable, which is often not exposed to
 *    API, note as a TODO step; otherwise omit actual audit log validation).
 *
 * This test ensures secure and permanent removal of privileged users, required
 * for regulatory compliance and operational integrity.
