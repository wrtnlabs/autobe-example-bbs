/**
 * Validate that members cannot delete attachments they did not upload.
 *
 * This test verifies permissions enforcement in the discussion board attachment
 * deletion API by having two different members. Member A creates a topic, a
 * thread, and a post with an attachment. Then, after switching context to
 * Member B, it attempts to delete Member A’s attachment using the designated
 * API. The deletion should fail with a permission error: only the uploader (or
 * admin/moderator) is permitted. This validates correct per-member access and
 * ensures the integrity of others’ uploaded content.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Register Member A (and authenticate as Member A)
 * 2. Member A creates a topic
 * 3. Member A creates a thread under this topic
 * 4. Member A creates a post in the thread, uploading an attachment (simulate or
 *    mock to obtain at least one attachmentId returned)
 * 5. Register Member B (and authenticate as Member B)
 * 6. Member B attempts to delete the attachment from Member A’s post (using postId
 *    and attachmentId)
 * 7. Confirm an error is thrown (permission denied/forbidden)
 * 8. (Optionally) As Member A or C, confirm the attachment still exists
