/**
 * Validate restriction on creating threads in closed discussion topics.
 *
 * This test ensures that the API prevents creating a new thread under a topic
 * that is marked as closed (`closed: true`). According to business rules,
 * closed topics do not accept new threadsâ€”such as for locked or archived
 * discussions.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Fetch a topic by ID and verify it is closed (closed=true).
 * 2. Attempt to create a thread under this closed topic.
 * 3. Confirm that the system rejects the creation attempt with an error.
 *
 * Edge Cases:
 *
 * - If the selected topic is not closed, the test aborts to avoid false
 *   negatives.
 * - Only checks that an error occurs, not error message/type.
 * - Ensures test is robust against data setup drift in the backend.
 *
 * Note: In real E2E setup, ensure a closed topic exists in the test DB
 * (closed=true). If not, this test will abort with an error message for
 * maintainers.
