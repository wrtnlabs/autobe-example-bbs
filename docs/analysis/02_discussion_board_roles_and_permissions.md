# Discussion Board Roles and Permissions

## 1. Overview
This document defines the permissions structure and authentication rules for the Discussion Board module. It outlines all available roles—admin, moderator, member, guest—along with their capabilities, the governing authentication and authorization policies, and guidance for extensibility and integration.

## 2. Role Definitions

- **Admin**: Full platform control, including user, content, settings, reports, and analytics management.
- **Moderator**: Can review, edit, approve, delete, or hide posts/comments, handle user reports, enforce guidelines, and escalate issues to admin.
- **Member**: Authenticated users able to create/reply to topics, edit/delete own posts, and report content.
- **Guest**: Unauthenticated users permitted only to browse public content; cannot interact (like, comment, report) or access restricted forums/topics.

## 3. Permissions Matrix

| Action                        | Admin | Moderator | Member | Guest |
|-------------------------------|:-----:|:---------:|:------:|:-----:|
| Access all topics             |   ✓   |     ✓     |   ✓    |   ✓   |
| Create topics/posts/comments  |   ✓   |     ✓     |   ✓    |   ✗   |
| Edit/delete any post/comment  |   ✓   |     ✓     |   ✗    |   ✗   |
| Edit/delete own post/comment  |   ✓   |     ✓     |   ✓    |   ✗   |
| Moderate reports              |   ✓   |     ✓     |   ✗    |   ✗   |
| View analytics                |   ✓   |     ✗     |   ✗    |   ✗   |
| Configure board/topics        |   ✓   |     ✗     |   ✗    |   ✗   |
| Report content                |   ✓   |     ✓     |   ✓    |   ✗   |

## 4. Role-Based Requirements (EARS)
THE system SHALL restrict topic creation to authenticated users with at least member privileges.

WHEN a moderator or admin detects inappropriate content, THE system SHALL enable post hiding, editing, or deletion.

IF a guest attempts to interact beyond browsing, THEN THE system SHALL redirect to login or show an access denied message.

WHEN a user reports content, THE system SHALL notify moderators and log the report for further review.

## 5. Authentication Policies (EARS-Compliant and Expanded)
WHEN accessing protected actions (post, edit, reply, report, moderate), THE system SHALL verify that the user’s session token is valid and maps to an active role with the required permissions.

WHERE multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled for admins, THE system SHALL prompt for an additional factor upon login for all admin users.

WHILE the user session is active, THE system SHALL associate every action with the user’s role and ID for traceability.

IF a user’s account is suspended or deactivated, THEN THE system SHALL immediately revoke access to all protected actions, including ongoing sessions.

**Practical Use Cases & Edge Cases:**
- For forums integrated with Single Sign-On (SSO), THE system SHALL respect external identity providers' role assertions to map users seamlessly into board roles, preventing privilege escalation during the mapping process.
- WHEN an expired authentication token is detected during an API request (e.g., posting a comment), THE system SHALL respond with a clear error, prompting the user to re-authenticate, ensuring that failed or unsafe transactions do not alter the board state.

## 6. Notes on Extensibility (EARS-Compliant and Expanded)
WHEN a new role (e.g., "Trusted Contributor") is needed, THE system SHALL allow role definitions, including unique permissions, to be added via admin UI or configuration, ensuring future feature growth does not require codebase changes for basic permission assignment.

WHERE integration with external moderation tools (e.g., automated toxicity detection) is configured, THE system SHALL treat external moderation outcomes as input events and apply mapped actions (hide, escalate, notify) according to admin-defined policy.

**Examples & Integration Scenarios:**
- WHEN integrating with an external project management tool (like Jira), THE system SHALL provide an API for admins to sync roles, such that task assignments on Jira can influence a user’s board permissions temporarily.
- When GDPR compliance is required, THE system SHALL allow role-based access to personal data, ensuring only admins can execute user data export or anonymization.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria (EARS-Compliant and Expanded)
WHEN configuring permissions via admin dashboard, THE system SHALL save changes instantly and apply them across all active sessions, guaranteeing that new permission rules take effect immediately.

IF a member tries to edit another user’s post, THEN THE system SHALL block the action and provide a standard error message explaining insufficient permissions.

WHEN a guest attempts to report content, THE system SHALL deny the request and prompt for registration or login, ensuring reporting is only available to authenticated users.

**Practical Acceptance Scenarios:**
- For edge cases like revoked moderator privileges, THE system SHALL ensure that active web sockets and background moderation tasks are disconnected or reassigned without data loss.
- WHEN roles or permissions are modified in an integrated HR system, THE system SHALL reconcile changes on the board within five minutes, guaranteeing role synchronization throughout the platform.
