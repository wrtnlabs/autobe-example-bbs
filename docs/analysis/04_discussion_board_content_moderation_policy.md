# Discussion Board Content Moderation Policy

## Overview
This document outlines the content moderation policies and recommended approaches for maintaining a civil, inclusive, and respectful environment on a political/economic discussion board. It is designed to help moderators and the community reduce toxicity, encourage productive dialogue, and protect user rights, while ensuring adherence to community standards and legal requirements.

## Objectives
- Foster respectful and fact-based political/economic discussions
- Prevent the spread of misinformation, hate speech, and harassment
- Balance free expression with harm reduction
- Provide clear, transparent procedures for moderation actions
- Enable scalable and consistent moderation practices

## Moderation Principles
1. **Fairness:** Apply rules equally to all users, regardless of viewpoint.
2. **Transparency:** Clearly communicate moderation actions and rationales.
3. **Accountability:** Maintain audit trails for moderator actions; enable user appeals.
4. **Inclusivity:** Ensure diverse perspectives are protected, provided they conform to standards.

## Moderation Process
1. **Pre-Moderation:**
   - Automated filters flag prohibited content (e.g., hate speech, threats).
   - New users' posts may be reviewed manually before publishing.
2. **Community Reporting:**
   - Users can report inappropriate posts; threshold-based escalation to moderators.
3. **Moderator Review:**
   - Moderators assess flagged or reported content against policy criteria.
   - Use a three-tier action escalation: warning → temporary suspension → permanent ban.
4. **Right of Appeal:**
   - Users can appeal moderation outcomes. Appeals reviewed by a separate moderator.

## Enforcement Actions
- **Content Removal**: Delete or edit content violating policies.
- **User Warnings**: Issue warnings with clear explanations.
- **Suspensions**: Temporary removal of posting/comment privileges (with defined durations).
- **Permanent Ban**: For egregious or repeated violations.

## Record-Keeping & Transparency
- Log all moderation actions (with timestamps, reasons, moderator ID)
- Publish regular transparency reports: statistics on moderation activities without user-identifiable data
- Provide users with reasons for any action taken on their content

## Appeals and Dispute Resolution
- Users can request a review of any moderation action within 7 days.
- Review panel includes at least two moderators not involved in the original decision.
- Decisions communicated to the user within 72 hours of appeal submission.

## Non-Moderation Guidelines
- Encouragement of self-moderation: Promote upvoting/downvoting for community-driven visibility.
- Allow non-flagged controversial opinions, provided they do not cross into policy violations.

## Continuous Improvement
- Moderation guidelines to be reviewed quarterly in response to emerging risks and feedback.
- Solicit user feedback on policy clarity and fairness.
