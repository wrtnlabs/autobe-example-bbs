# Discussion Board Deployment Considerations

## Overview
This document outlines essential deployment considerations for launching and sustaining a discussion board platform. It is tailored for non-technical stakeholders, focusing on policy, environmental, and process aspects rather than technical infrastructure details. The aim is to ensure a smooth rollout and reliable operation, minimizing risk and maximizing service quality.

## 1. Hosting Environment
- **Cloud or On-premises:** Select between cloud solutions (recommended for scalability and managed maintenance) or on-premises servers (for additional data control).
- **Regional Compliance:** Hosting location must adhere to relevant data privacy and security regulations pertinent to your users (e.g., GDPR, local laws).

## 2. Security and Privacy
- **User Authentication:** Implement user authentication to prevent unauthorized access. Integrate with single sign-on (SSO) if used internally.
- **Data Encryption:** Ensure data is encrypted both during transmission (HTTPS/SSL) and when stored.
- **Data Management Policies:** Define data retention and deletion policies, specifying how long posts and user data are stored and procedures for data removal upon request.
- **Access Controls:** Establish user roles and permissions aligned with business rules ([see roles & permissions](./03_discussion_board_user_roles_permissions.md)).

## 3. Scalability and Performance
- **Expected Load Assessment:** Estimate peak and average user numbers, post volumes, and traffic trends for accurate resource provisioning.
- **Auto-scaling:** Prefer hosting and platforms that support automatic resource scaling to handle usage spikes with minimal manual intervention.

## 4. Maintenance and Monitoring
- **Regular Backups:** Schedule automatic regular backups of all user data, posts, and metadata.
- **Uptime Monitoring:** Use automated tools to monitor service availability, with alerts for disruptions or degradations.
- **Error Logging:** Collect system errors and user-reported issues for timely diagnostics and resolution.

## 5. Content Moderation
- **Policy Enforcement:** Prepare operational workflows and designated moderators to act on reports and enforce usage policies ([content moderation policy](./04_discussion_board_content_moderation_policy.md)).
- **Automated Filters:** If possible, implement automated tools for spam and inappropriate content detection.

## 6. Business Continuity
- **Disaster Recovery Plan:** Document steps for restoring service in the event of hardware failure or data breach, including contact details for key personnel.
- **Change Management:** Define approval and rollback processes for major updates or feature deployments.

## 7. User Support & Communication
- **Help Channels:** Ensure users know how to reach support for reporting issues, requesting features, or asking questions.
- **Outage Notices:** Prepare templates and contact channels for communicating planned downtimes or unexpected outages.

## 8. Legal and Compliance
- **Terms of Service & Privacy Policy:** Ensure clear, up-to-date user-facing policies covering content posting, privacy, and forbidden conduct.
- **Accessibility:** Aim to comply with accessibility standards so all users can participate.
