# Overview and Goals

## Project Overview
This project aims to create an accessible online discussion board dedicated to thoughtful discourse on political and economic subjects. Designed for a broad audience—including those without prior experience in software development or technical fields—the platform will provide a welcoming environment where users can post, comment, and engage with diverse perspectives on important issues.

The system will borrow best practices from successful online forums, focusing on robust user engagement, healthy discussion, and community-driven moderation. The project scope covers both core discussion functions and clear business rules, ensuring the platform remains useful, safe, and respectful.

## Objectives
- **Foster Civil Discussion**: Enable open, respectful conversations about political and economic topics among users of varying backgrounds.
- **Accessibility and Ease-of-Use**: Design the platform so anyone can register, participate, and moderate with minimal learning curve or technical knowledge.
- **Community Empowerment**: Incorporate roles such as regular users, moderators, and admins to ensure fair and effective self-governance.
- **Feature-Rich Forum**: Provide essential tools like posting, commenting, upvoting, downvoting, and basic reporting to maximize engagement.
- **Trust and Safety**: Implement clear and fair rules, along with user moderation, to minimize abuse and foster a trustworthy space.
- **Sustainable Growth**: Establish scalable foundations for future features as community needs evolve, such as advanced moderation or analytics.
