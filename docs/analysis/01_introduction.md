# Introduction

This document serves as the introduction to the Political and Economic Discussion Board project. The main goal is to develop an accessible, user-friendly online platform where individuals can engage in thoughtful discussion and debate related to political and economic issues. This project is designed for users who may not have prior experience with software design or programming, ensuring that all concepts are communicated in a clear and approachable manner.

## Purpose

Modern social and online platforms often lack specialized spaces for civil, focused, and meaningful conversation about politics and economics. By launching a dedicated discussion board, we aim to provide a community for sharing perspectives, debating ideas, learning from others, and improving public discourse surrounding these important topics.

## Project Vision

- **Foster Informed Discussion:** Enable users with diverse views to exchange ideas and information constructively.
- **Promote Civil Engagement:** Encourage respectful communication and enforce rules for polite discourse.
- **Accessible to Everyone:** Design features and workflows so that people with little to no technical experience can participate easily.
- **Safety and Moderation:** Create clear guidelines and robust moderation practices to ensure safety and trust within the community.

## Key Concepts Explained

- **Discussion Board:** An online space where users can start conversations (called "threads" or "posts") and others can join in by commenting or reacting.
- **Moderation:** Some users are given special permissions to oversee the platform, remove inappropriate content, and help keep discussions on track.
- **User Roles:** Different levels of access are assigned to various users (for example, regular users vs. moderators or administrators).
- **Core Features:** Standard elements like posting and commenting, voting on posts, and flagging inappropriate behavior are central to the experience.

## Document Overview

The following sections of this documentation will explain the vision, features, user roles, business rules, user interface requirements, moderation standards, and future enhancement plans for the discussion board in detail. Every effort has been made to keep the language accessible and free from technical jargon. 

This introduction is intended to establish a shared understanding of the project's purpose and aims for all stakeholders, regardless of their technical background.
