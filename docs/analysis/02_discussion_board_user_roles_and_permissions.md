## 3. Role Responsibilities
- **Guest**: Access to general board content only; cannot participate in discussions or interact.
- **Member**: Drives discussions, contributes content, manages own posts, and reports issues.
- **Moderator**: Reviews flagged content, edits or removes inappropriate posts, and provides community support.
- **Administrator**: Oversees all system operations, manages users and roles, configures policies, and ensures uptime/security.

---

## 4. Authentication and Authorization Logic
- **Guests**: Sessions are tracked anonymously; no authentication needed.
- **Members**: Must complete registration and verification to receive authenticated sessions; all interactive actions require authentication.
- **Moderators & Administrators**: Roles assigned by administrator, requiring additional verification and logged access for transparency. All privileged actions are recorded.

All roles are evaluated at each endpoint/action via API middleware to ensure consistent permissions enforcement.

## 5. Role-Based User Flows

### Guest
1. Accesses site without logging in.
2. Browses available public threads and topics.
3. Tries to interact (e.g., comment) — redirected to sign-up/login page.

### Member
1. Registers and logs in to the system.
2. Creates a new discussion or participates in existing topics.
3. Edits or deletes their own contributions.
4. Reports inappropriate content for review.

### Moderator
1. Signs in and receives moderation panel access.
2. Reviews reports, edits or removes problematic content.
3. Communicates with members as needed.

### Administrator
1. Logs in with admin credentials.
2. Configures system settings, assigns moderator roles, audits activity.
3. Manages user accounts, security, and site-wide policies.

## 6. Security Considerations
- All role escalations are subject to strict validation and auditing.
- Privileged actions are logged for compliance and traceability.
- Lost credential recovery is managed by administrators only.
