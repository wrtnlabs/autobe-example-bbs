# 08. Technical Requirements

## 1. Overview
This section outlines the technical requirements for the discussion board focused on political and economic conversations. The aim is to ensure the platform is secure, scalable, user-friendly, and compliant with standard discussion forum expectations—even for those without technical experience. All requirements are explained clearly to aid both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## 2. Platform Choices
- **Web-Based Platform**: The discussion board should be accessible via standard internet browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Responsive Design**: The user interface must adapt smoothly across various devices and screen sizes for a seamless experience.

## 3. Security Requirements
- **User Authentication**: Support secure account creation, login, password reset, and email verification.
- **Data Protection**: All communications and user data transfers between browser and server must be encrypted (using HTTPS).
- **Spam & Abuse Prevention**: Implement CAPTCHA during registration and posting to block bots and reduce spam.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Permissions defined by user roles (regular member, moderator, admin) to prevent unauthorized actions.
- **Content Moderation**: Tools for reporting and removing inappropriate content, with audit trails for moderator/admin actions.

## 4. Scalability & Performance
- **Efficient Data Handling**: The system should perform smoothly even as users and posts grow.
- **Load Balancing (Optional for Launch)**: For future growth, consider options to distribute traffic across servers.
- **Caching**: Frequently accessed topics or posts should be cached for quick retrieval.

## 5. Data Storage & Backup
- **Database**: All posts, comments, votes, and user activities will be stored in a reliable database system.
- **Regular Backups**: Automated, secure backups must be scheduled to prevent data loss in case of issues.
- **User Privacy**: Only necessary personal data is stored; all sensitive information is handled per best practices.

## 6. Integration and Extensibility
- **APIs**: Plan for potential future API integration to allow for mobile apps, analytics, or advanced moderation.
- **Third-Party Services**: The platform may integrate with third-party authentication and analytics tools—ensure these are secure and respect privacy.

## 7. Accessibility & Usability
- **WCAG Compliance**: Ensure the website meets Web Content Accessibility Guidelines for users with disabilities.
- **Simple Navigation**: The design must support intuitive navigation, clearly labeled buttons, and helpful tooltips.

## 8. Monitoring & Reporting
- **Automated Monitoring**: The platform should automatically monitor uptime, usage, and potential security threats.
- **Reporting Dashboard**: Admins and moderators should have access to statistics on user activity, flagged content, and system health.

## 9. Maintenance and Support
- **Regular Updates**: The system should be easy to update for security patches and feature improvements.
- **Support Channels**: Provide a contact method or help page for users to report issues or ask questions.
