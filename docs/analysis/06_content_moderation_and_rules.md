# 06. Content Moderation and Rules

## Overview
Ensuring constructive and respectful discussions on political and economic topics is crucial to maintaining a healthy online community. This section outlines the principles, rules, and processes for content moderation, focusing both on automated and human moderation methods. Moderation minimizes harmful content, misinformation, and disruptive behaviors, fostering an accessible and inclusive environment for all users.

## Moderation Principles
- **Transparency:** All moderation actions, such as post removals or bans, are accompanied by clear explanations.
- **Fairness:** Rules are applied equally to all users, regardless of perspective.
- **Education:** When possible, moderators explain problematic behaviors and suggest improvements.

## Types of Moderators
- **Automated Moderation:** Tools that automatically block or flag posts with profanity, hate speech, spam, or banned topics (using defined keyword lists and pattern recognition).
- **Human Moderators:** Trained individuals who review reports, intervene in disputes, remove problematic content, and guide community standards.

## Moderation Workflow
1. **Content Creation:** Users submit posts, comments, or replies.
2. **Automated Checks:** System uses filters to detect violations (profanity, personal attacks, off-topic content).
3. **Community Reporting:** Users can flag content as inappropriate.
4. **Moderator Review:** Human moderators evaluate flagged content and apply appropriate actions (removal, warning, suspension).
5. **Appeal Process:** Users may appeal decisions to moderators for review.

## Content Rules
- **Stay On Topic:** All posts and comments must be relevant to political or economic discussions.
- **Respect Others:** Personal attacks, hate speech, harassment, or threats are strictly prohibited.
- **Fact-Based Discussions:** Encourage use of sources and data when making claims. Deliberate misinformation or conspiracy theories are not allowed.
- **No Spam:** Promotional content, repetitive posts, or off-topic links will be removed.
- **No NSFW/Illegal Content:** Content that is sexually explicit, violent, or illegal is strictly banned.
- **Civility Requirements:** Discuss topics respectfully; heated debate is acceptable, but uncivil conduct is not tolerated.

## Actions for Rule Violations
| Violation Type         | First Offense                  | Repeated Offenses              |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|

| Major (harassment)    | Content removal & warning     | Ban from platform             |
