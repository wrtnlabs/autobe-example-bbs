## Flow of Permissions Management

1. **Account Creation:**
   - Visitors may join by creating an account, becoming Registered Users.
2. **User Actions:**
   - Registered Users enjoy core features: posting, commenting, and voting.
3. **Moderation Escalation:**
   - Problematic users or posts are first addressed by Moderators, who apply content rules and, if necessary, escalate to Admins.
4. **Administrative Control:**
   - Admins retain ultimate authority for configuring site-wide policies, and managing users & roles.

---

## Key Principles
- **Transparency:** All major actions (e.g., content takedowns, bans) are logged for accountability.
- **Trust Progression:** Users must build a positive participation record before being considered for Moderator status.
- **Safety:** Role permissions are separated to prevent abuse and protect user data.
