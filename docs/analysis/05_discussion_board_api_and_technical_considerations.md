# API & Technical Considerations for Discussion Board

## Overview
This document outlines the essential API, authentication, and technical security considerations for implementing the discussion board service. It includes integrated references to roles, permissions, and user journeys to ensure a comprehensive technical foundation for development teams and vendors.

## Roles & Permissions
Roles and permissions are fundamental to access control across all API endpoints. This section summarizes assigned roles and the EARS-format permissions for each:

- **admin**: Full management, including moderation, user account control, configuration, and analytics access.
- **moderator**: Moderate discussions, review/resolve reports, enforce guidelines.
- **member**: Authenticated users posting topics, comments, and reporting inappropriate content.
- **guest**: Unauthenticated users, read-only access to public discussions.

### EARS-Formatted Requirements:
- THE API SHALL restrict administrative operations to users with the 'admin' role.
- THE API SHALL allow only 'moderator' and 'admin' roles to moderate content and resolve reported issues.
- THE API SHALL permit 'member' role users to create topics, post comments, and report content.
- THE API SHALL restrict guests to read-only access on designated endpoints.
- IF a user attempts an unauthorized operation, THEN THE API SHALL return a standardized error response.

## User Journeys
User journeys impact API flows and response structures. The discussion board supports the following high-level journeys:

- **Registration & Authentication:** Users register, authenticate, and are assigned roles based on sign-up flow.
- **Participation:** Authenticated users join discussions by posting, commenting, and reacting.
- **Moderation:** Reports on inappropriate content trigger moderation actions; moderators/admins take resolution steps.
- **Browsing as Guest:** Guests view public boards but cannot participate until authenticated.

### EARS-Formatted Requirements:
- WHEN a user creates an account, THE API SHALL assign an initial role based on business logic.
- WHEN a member posts or comments, THE API SHALL validate authentication and enforce content filters.
- IF a report is submitted, THEN THE API SHALL notify moderators and allow subsequent review actions.
- WHILE a user is unauthenticated, THE API SHALL prevent access to post or comment endpoints.

---
## API Authentication & Security Practices

- THE API SHALL use secure authentication protocols such as OAuth 2.0 or JWT.
- THE API SHALL require token-based validation for all endpoints except those designated as public/read-only.
- IF authentication tokens are invalid or expired, THEN THE API SHALL return a 401 Unauthorized response.
- THE API SHALL utilize HTTPS/TLS for all client-server communications.
- WHEN sensitive operations are performed, THE API SHALL log the actor, action, and timestamp for auditing.

---
## User Account Management

- THE API SHALL enforce role consistency during user creation, update, and deletion operations.
- WHEN passwords or credentials are handled, THE API SHALL store them using industry-standard cryptographic hashing with salt.
- IF role elevation or privilege changes occur, THEN THE API SHALL trigger a verification and audit process.
- THE API SHALL provide comprehensive error codes and messages to support troubleshooting and secure monitoring.

## Summary
This document integrates roles, permissions, user journeys, security, and account management requirements to guide robust, secure, and reliable implementation of the discussion board APIs for all stakeholders.
