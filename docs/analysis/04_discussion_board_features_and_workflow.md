# Discussion Board Features and Workflow

## Overview
This document defines the core features and workflows of the discussion board system. All requirements are specified in EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) format to ensure clarity and testability. This document is self-contained, with no external document references.

## Core Features

### Topic and Thread Management
- THE discussion board SHALL allow users to create new discussion topics.
- WHEN a user creates a topic, THE system SHALL record the creator, timestamp, and topic metadata.
- THE system SHALL display a list of available topics that can be browsed or searched.
- WHEN a topic is selected, THE system SHALL display all associated threads and posts.
- THE system SHALL allow admins and moderators to pin, close, or delete topics.

### Posting and Commenting
- THE system SHALL allow members to submit posts under topics.
- WHEN a member submits a post, THE system SHALL record the author, content, timestamp, and any attachments.
- THE system SHALL allow replies to posts, enabling threaded discussions.
- IF a guest attempts to post or comment, THEN THE system SHALL prompt the user to register or log in.
- WHILE a topic is closed, THE system SHALL restrict new posts and comments.

### Moderation
- THE system SHALL provide admins and moderators with tools to edit, move, or remove posts and comments.
- WHEN an admin or moderator edits or deletes a post, THE system SHALL log the action and responsible user.
- THE system SHALL allow admins to define permissions for each user role (admin, moderator, member, guest).
- IF a post is reported or flagged by users, THEN THE system SHALL notify moderators for review.

### User Management and Permissions
- THE system SHALL enforce role-based access control for all core actions.
- WHERE a user is an admin, THE system SHALL grant full content and user management rights.
- WHERE a user is a moderator, THE system SHALL grant content moderation privileges except for admin-only actions.
- WHERE a user is a member, THE system SHALL permit content participation but not moderation.
- WHERE a user is a guest, THE system SHALL limit access to read-only browsing.

### Reporting and Abuse Handling
- THE system SHALL allow users to report posts/comments for inappropriate content.
- WHEN a report is submitted, THE system SHALL timestamp the report and record associated user and content.
- WHEN reported content is reviewed, THE system SHALL log the outcome (dismissed, action taken) and responsible moderator.

### Notification and Subscription
- THE system SHALL allow users to subscribe to topics or threads.
- WHEN there are new posts or comments in subscribed topics/threads, THE system SHALL notify the subscriber via their preferred method (e.g., email or in-app notification).

## Workflow Summary

1. **Topic Creation:** Members create topics; admins/moderators may manage them.
2. **Discussion:** Members post and comment; guests have read-only access.
3. **Moderation:** Admins/moderators review, edit, remove, or move content as needed; actions are logged.
4. **Reporting:** Users report content; moderators review; outcomes are tracked.
5. **Notification:** Users choose to follow topics/threads and receive updates.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- THE system SHALL maintain high availability with 99.5% uptime.
- THE system SHALL support internationalization for multi-language use.
- THE system SHALL ensure data consistency and reliable audit logging for all moderation events.
- THE system SHALL respond to user actions within 2 seconds under normal load conditions.
- THE system SHALL provide accessibility features for all core interactions.
