# Discussion Board Overview

## Executive Summary
This document provides an executive overview of the Political/Economic Discussion Board project. The discussion board is designed as a dynamic online platform intended to facilitate high-quality, respectful, and open exchanges on political and economic topics. By offering an organized space for diverse dialogue, the platform aims to inform, educate, and empower users ranging from casual readers to expert contributors.

## Purpose and Vision
The primary purpose of the discussion board is to foster thoughtful, fact-based debate and knowledge-sharing within communities interested in governance, economics, policymaking, and related domains. The vision is to create a trusted forum where individuals can discuss ideas, contest opinions, and broaden their understanding in a non-partisan, well-moderated environment.

## Business Context
Discourse about political and economic issues often suffers from fragmentation, lack of moderation, and echo chambers. This project addresses these challenges by introducing a community-run board with clear responsibilities, structured topics, and mechanisms for feedback. The platform’s design supports scalability for growing user bases and topical expansions.

## User Personas
- **Administrators**: Responsible for overall system management, enforcement of platform policies, and configuration of discussion topics.
- **Moderators**: Charged with maintaining order, mediating disputes, reviewing user-generated content, and upholding community guidelines.
- **Members**: Authenticated users who create content, join discussions, voice opinions, and contribute to the board’s vibrancy.
- **Guests**: Non-registered visitors who can view but not participate, serving as potential new members.

## Key Objectives
- THE platform SHALL enable structured, transparent, and civil conversations around political and economic issues.
- THE system SHALL ensure a safe space for discourse through effective moderation and clear role definition.
- THE service SHALL provide seamless onboarding for new members while protecting community standards.
- THE discussion board SHALL be scalable and maintainable as user numbers and topics increase.

## Target Outcomes

## Governance and Ethics
