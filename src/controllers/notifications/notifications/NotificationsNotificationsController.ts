  /**
   * Update an individual notification by ID in the 'notifications' table.
   *
   * This operation allows a user to update a specific notification record,
   * such as marking it as read after viewing or amending associated data
   * (e.g., message, type). The 'notifications' table is central for tracking
   * delivery and read status of all notifications for the platform (see
   * notification delivery requirements).
   *
   * Permission checks ensure that only the owner (the notification's
   * recipient) can update their own notifications. Attempts to update
   * notifications belonging to other users should result in a permissions
   * error. Every update triggers schema validation—e.g., ensuring 'is_read'
   * is a boolean. All updates are recorded with audit information (who made
   * the change, timestamp) for compliance with transparency and security
   * requirements (see privacy and business rule sections).
   *
   * The notification update operation is commonly paired with client polling
   * or user interface actions such as "clear notifications" or "mark all as
   * read". Related notification endpoints include retrieving (GET), creating
   * (POST/system), and deleting (DELETE) notifications.
   *
   * Error scenarios include not found (invalid id), permission denied, and
   * malformed update data.
   *
   * @param id Unique identifier of the notification to update.
   * @param body New values for the notification record (e.g., is_read).

  /**
   * Delete a notification by ID from the 'notifications' table.
   *
   * Allows a user to permanently delete (not just mark as read/unread) a
   * specific notification from their personal notification list. The
   * underlying 'notifications' table enforces full audit/ownership—the
   * operation must check that only the recipient can delete their own
   * notifications.
   *
   * Once deleted, the notification record is removed and will no longer
   * appear in user views. This supports user control over their notification
   * history, aligning with privacy and data management principles outlined in
   * the requirements.
   *
   * All deletes must be strictly checked for permission (ownership), and
   * proper logging/auditing of the deletion event is required. Edge cases
   * include attempting to delete a non-existent notification or one that
   * doesn't belong to the requester, resulting in appropriate errors (404 Not
