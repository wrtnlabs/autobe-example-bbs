   * Create a notification preference record in 'notification_preferences'.
   *
   * This operation creates a new notification preference identified by user
   * ID and notification type, enabling the user to set up their own custom
   * delivery toggles (e.g., enable/disable upvote notifications, reply
   * alerts). Data is stored in the normalized 'notification_preferences'
   * table per Prisma schema.
   *
   * All new records are schema-validated (e.g., allowed notification types,
   * boolean enabled status) and checked for duplicates (unique per (user,
   * type)). Security rules restrict users so they can create preferences only
   * for themselves unless an admin overrides. Errors include duplicate
   * preference (already exists for this type), invalid data, or permissions
   * failures. This endpoint is often used during onboarding or when adding
   * new notification features/capabilities to the app.
   *
   * The endpoint pairs with patch (list/search), get (fetch), put (update),
   * and delete (remove) for CRUD coverage of notification settings.
   *
   * @param body Data to create the notification preference (user, type,
   *   enabled).

   *
   * This operation retrieves a paginated, filterable list of notification

   * types/delivery. Typical filters include notification type,
   * enabled/disabled status, or user associations.

   * are supported. Error scenarios include invalid search criteria, exceeding
   * pagination limits, or permission errors for non-owners/admins.
