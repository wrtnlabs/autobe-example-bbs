   * This endpoint is reserved primarily for administrative/system use cases
   * such as broadcasts, moderator/civil warnings, or test notifications. Only
   * privileged roles can trigger arbitrary notifications. Not used for
   * ordinary comment/reply notifications, which are handled automatically in
   * business logic. Body must specify recipient, type, preview, URL, etc, as
   * per the Prisma comments.
   *
   * Validation rules:
   *
   * - Recipient_member_id and type (category) are required
   * - Manual trigger_actor_id is optional (may be null/system)
   * - Follows all audit and security logging rules.
   *
   * Related endpoints:
   *
   * - PATCH /discussionBoard/notifications (list)
   * - GET /discussionBoard/notifications/{id}
   * - PUT /discussionBoard/notifications/{id} to update read state
   * - DELETE /discussionBoard/notifications/{id} to remove/delete notification
   *
   * All input must be validated for user existence and permission.

   *
   * List and search all notification events for the currently logged-in user.
   *
   * The endpoint supports pagination and filtering, including by read/unread
   * status, notification type, time range, and text search on
   * content_preview. Returns a paginated, sorted list of notifications
   * (unread first, then by most recent as default). This complies with F07
   * (user notification UX) and privacy requirements so that users can only
   * access their own notifications.
   *
   * Supports advanced sorting and filtering as described in the schema,
   * including delivered_at and created_at. If a notification is deleted
   * (soft-delete), it will not show in standard results unless explicitly
   * filtered.
   *

   * - POST /discussionBoard/notifications for manual notification triggers
   *   (e.g., admin scanning)
   * - PUT /discussionBoard/notifications/{id} for marking as read
   * - DELETE /discussionBoard/notifications/{id} for deleting a notification
