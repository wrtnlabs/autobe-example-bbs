   * This endpoint retrieves a paginated list of moderation log entries for
   * the discussion board. Designed for use by moderators or administrators,
   * it enables efficient review of moderation actions based on filters such
   * as moderator, action type, or target content (thread, post, comment).
   *
   * The endpoint references the discussion_board_moderation_logs table as
   * outlined in the Prisma DB schema. It supports audit and compliance
   * requirements by exposing a detailed history of moderator actions (e.g.,
   * hide, delete, warn) with ability to search by timestamp, action type, or
   * target identifier.
   *
   * Security: Authorization is required—only users with moderator or
   * administrator privileges can access this endpoint. Sensitive moderation
   * details are only visible to authorized roles, and all access is logged
   * per non-functional requirements.
   *
   * Validation: All search, filter, and pagination parameters are validated
   * for type and range. The response includes data, total count, and relevant
   * paging information.
   *
   * Business logic: Used for compliance, transparency, and support of audit
   * workflows. This endpoint is typically accompanied by detail, creation,
   * and update endpoints for moderation logs.
