   * Create a new comment reply (discussion_board_comment_reply table).
   *
   * This API enables a registered user to create a new threaded reply to an
   * existing comment, fulfilling the inline and nested discussion
   * requirements for political/economic conversations. The endpoint ensures
   * that each reply is atomic and references its parent comment and author
   * per the discussion_board_comment_reply schema. Reply content must be text
   * and not null.
   *
   * Relations: The reply is linked to a comment via parent_comment_id and
   * owned by a user. Moderation policies apply, including tracking who
   * authored the reply and possible future moderation actions (edit, delete,
   * report). On creation, notifications may be triggered for the original
   * comment author according to project rules. Validation includes confirming
   * the comment exists, the user is valid, and content is not empty or
   * inappropriate (filtered per moderation policies).
   *
   * Security: Only authenticated, active users can create replies, and
   * anti-spam controls may apply. Subsequent usages include displaying
   * threaded conversations and supporting content moderation review. Errors
   * may include forbidden access, invalid parent comment, or content
   * validation failure.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Information required to create a new comment reply.

   *
   * This endpoint lists or searches comment-replies, which are thread-level

   * schema. Filter/search fields can include comment author, parent comment,
   * content search (gin_trgm), and temporal windows (created/updated).
   * Pagination is applied for efficient large-set view. Non-authorized users
   * may not see deleted/hidden replies. Most common usage is for presenting
   * nested or threaded views under each post comment or for moderator audit.
   * Error scenarios include 400 for malformed filter, 401/403 for permission
   * errors, and 500 for internal failures. Soft-deleted replies are generally
   * hidden from normal listing but may be requested with moderator
   * privileges.
