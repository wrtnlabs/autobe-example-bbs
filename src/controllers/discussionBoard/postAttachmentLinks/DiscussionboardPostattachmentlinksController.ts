   * between an existing post and a file attachment, setting the display
   * order, enabled/disabled status, and recording creation metadata. This
   * operation allows users (with valid permission, e.g., post author/admin)
   * to attach files to posts in a specific sequence, and ensures that no
   * duplicate or invalid linkages are created.
   *
   * Input validation includes: verifying that the referenced post_id and
   * attachment_id exist and belong to the permitted user, that the
   * attachment_order value is unique within the post, and all accompanying
   * metadata (created_at, disabled) is correctly initialized.
   *
   * Authorization restricts creation privileges to valid owners or moderators
   * with content rights. Related endpoints: PATCH (search/list), GET
   * (single), PUT (update), DELETE (remove). Error handling covers 400
   * (invalid request), 403 (permission denied), and 409 (conflicting order or
   * duplicate link).

   * List/query post-attachment links (discussion_board_post_attachment_link)
   * with search and pagination support.
   *
   * The PATCH /discussionBoard/postAttachmentLinks endpoint queries the
   * post-attachment linking table, enabling advanced retrieval and search
   * features for listing all or filtered links between posts and attached
   * files. This endpoint is critical for reconstructing file presentation
   * orders, auditing file associations, and performing bulk attachment
   * management.
   *
   * Security considerations enforce that only authenticated users (and, if
   * needed, only those with admin or post owner privileges) can query post
   * attachment links.
   *
   * Business rules may include paginating lists of results, supporting text
   * search by post title/file names, and filtering by attachment status
   * (enabled/disabled). Relationships to users mean that the returned data
   * will often include join info such as file meta, user identity, and
   * possible soft-deletion status.
   *
   * Related endpoints are GET (for single records), POST (creation), PUT
   * (update), and DELETE (deletion). Requests that include complex search,
   * filtering, or sorting must use this PATCH endpoint for consistency with
   * other list-based resources. Error handling includes 404 (no results), 403
   * (unauthorized), and 400 (invalid search parameters).
