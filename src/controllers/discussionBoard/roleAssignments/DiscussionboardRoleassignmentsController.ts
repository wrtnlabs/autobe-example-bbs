   * Creates a new role assignment for a user

   *
   * This API endpoint creates a new role assignment for a user, as defined in
   * the discussion_board_role_assignment Prisma schema table. The endpoint
   * supports administrators in assigning a new role to a user, with strict
   * enforcement that each assignment is atomic and records both the
   * assignment timestamp and, optionally, a future revocation timestamp. This
   * operation is critical for upholding the role-based access control
   * described in the requirements analysis, allowing for fine-grained and
   * auditable management of member, moderator, admin, or guest privileges.
   *
   * The request body must include the user_id of the target, the role_type to
   * be assigned (valid roles: member, moderator, admin, guest), and the
   * assigned_at timestamp. The endpoint should validate that the role
   * assignment does not duplicate an active role for the same user and that
   * role revocation rules are followed. Proper handling of business errors
   * and permission checks must be enforced.
   *
   * Related endpoints include updating (PUT), deleting (DELETE), and listing
   * (PATCH) role assignments. Only users with the appropriate administrator
   * privileges can use this endpoint. Errors may occur if the user does not
   * exist, the role already exists for this user and period, or the
   * assignment data is invalid.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Information required to create a role assignment for a user.
