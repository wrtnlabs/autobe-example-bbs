   * search (by guest or member), storing key information such as the search
   * keyword(s), any applied filters (tags/categories/dates), the search
   * context, and the actor ID.
   *
   * Used for constructing personalized user experiences or audit trails. The
   * actor ID must be validated and tied to an active guest or member. Input
   * validation ensures proper query format and integrity. On success, the
   * created history record (with its UUID and timestamps) is returned.

   * Role-based access may restrict this operation to only authorized users or
   * system processes performing searches on behalf of users/guests.
