  /**
   * Soft-delete a discussion board member (discussion_board_members).
   *
   * This API endpoint allows administrators to soft-delete a member, marking
   * their profile as deleted without removing posts, votes, or other
   * associated records. The endpoint enforces RBAC: only administrators are
   * authorized. When a delete request arrives, the system checks if the
   * target member exists and is not already deleted. The member's deleted_at
   * field is set to the current timestamp, and their account is deactivated
   * (is_active becomes false for audit/traceability). Attempting to delete an
   * already-deleted or non-existent member returns a suitable error. In case
   * a member is involved in ongoing moderation actions, the soft-delete
   * ensures compliance logs are preserved. Deletion triggers a background
   * notification (eventual consistency) to purge session data and prevent
   * future logins. If the member had moderator/admin privileges, related
   * records in those tables are also soft-deleted.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param id Target member's ID (UUID) to delete.
