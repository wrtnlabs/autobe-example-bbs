   * subcategory snapshot. It is typically invoked during administrative edits
   * to forum subcategory metadata (name, description), to preserve a copy of
   * the subcategory's state before or after a change for full audit
   * compliance. The Prisma schema requires that snapshots include references
   * to the source subcategory and the user responsible for the change, along
   * with the name/description values.
   *
   * Access is restricted to staff-level users with moderator or admin roles,
   * with write authority. The request body must be a complete snapshot as per
   * the form fields described in the schema. Validations are performed for
   * data integrity, and errors include missing fields (400), forbidden access
   * (403), and internal errors (500). The response returns the newly created
   * snapshot record, confirming its persistent record in the audit log.

  /**
   * List/filter forum subcategory snapshots from

   *
   * This endpoint provides a list of all forum subcategory snapshots, each
   * representing a historical version of a subcategory. These records support
   * audit trails, moderation compliance, and potential restoration of
   * previous subcategory states as described in the Prisma schema. Only
   * moderators or admins should access this endpoint.
   *
   * The endpoint accepts a request body to specify search, filtering,
   * pagination, and sorting options. It allows narrow queries by
   * forum_subcategory_id, created_by_id, or time range, and supports sorting
   * the results by snapshot creation date or subcategory association. The
   * response is a paginated structure containing basic snapshot metadata and
   * navigation details. Soft-deleted snapshots are typically excluded from
   * results unless a special flag is specified.
   *
   * Error responses include improper permissions (403), malformed query
   * parameters (400), or internal server errors (500). Requests should be
   * authenticated with an appropriate staff-level (moderator/admin) token.

   *
   * This endpoint allows for updates to a forum subcategory snapshot,
   * identified by ID. The Prisma schema's comments detail the expectation
   * that snapshots are typically immutable, so this should only be used in
   * rare cases where corrections are legally required or for fixing major
   * audit discrepancies (for example, to correct abusive content that must
   * not be published, or to annotate a snapshot for legal hold). Use of this
   * endpoint is heavily restrictedâ€”only moderators/admins with the highest
   * authority should have access.
   *
   * Requires the unique snapshot ID as a path parameter. The request body
   * must specify only allowed fields as permitted by business rules (e.g.,
   * correction_reason, update_meta). Attempting to change historical fields
   * in ways that break audit trails should be strictly forbidden by both
   * application and review logic. Error conditions include not found (404),
   * forbidden (403), and validation errors (400).
   *
   * Every modification is itself auditable, and reasons for change should be
   * logged. The response returns the updated snapshot record as an assurance
   * of the change. Usage should be closely monitored.
