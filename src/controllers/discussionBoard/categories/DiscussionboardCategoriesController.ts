   * List and paginate all discussion board categories from the database.

   * Retrieves a paginated list of all discussion board categories from the
   * discussion_board_categories schema. The response includes the full list
   * of categories, each with metadata such as name, description, parent
   * category linkage, active status, and timestamps.
   *
   * This endpoint is public and designed for both logged-in and guest users.
   * It enables navigation of the discussion board structure and supports UIs
   * that visualize topic hierarchies. Security is not enforced because
   * category browsing is a non-sensitive operation, and no personal user data
   * is exposed.
   *
   * Behaviorally, it reflects the latest active/inactive category statuses
   * and parent-child relations. If categories are nested (using parent_id),
   * responses should preserve hierarchical context, but always as a flat
   * list. For bulk/batch operations or advanced filtering, use the
   * corresponding PATCH endpoint.
   *
   * Failure scenarios include database connectivity errors or malformed
   * pagination queries, which should produce user-friendly error responses.

   * Advanced search, filtering, and sorting of discussion board categories
   * with pagination.
   *
   * Performs advanced filtering, searching, and sorting over the
   * discussion_board_categories entries, supporting UI scenarios where users
   * or admins require search, sort, or filter beyond simple listing.
   *
   * The endpoint accepts structured request parameters for filtering category
   * name (with partial matching), selection by active/inactive status, date
   * range queries, and parent_id-based hierarchical filtering. Sorting
   * options may include created_at, updated_at, or name. Pagination is
   * enforced to prevent overwhelming responses.
   *
   * This endpoint is critical for administration UIs, analytics tools, or
   * advanced browsing for large category sets. Security is open, as
   * categories are non-sensitive, but filtering may be more useful for admin
   * roles. Misuse may be mitigated by rate limiting or authentication in
   * future deployments.
