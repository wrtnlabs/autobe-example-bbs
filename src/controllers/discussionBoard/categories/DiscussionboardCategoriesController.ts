  /**
   * Update a specific discussion board category

   *
   * This API operation enables the update of a single discussion board
   * category identified by its unique ID. The endpoint relies on the
   * `discussion_board_categories` table, which stores the site's
   * organizational taxonomy, supporting forum browsing, search filtering, and
   * topic grouping.
   *
   * Updates allowed include the category name, description, and possibly
   * soft-delete restoration. The request body follows the `.IUpdate` pattern
   * and may be restricted to administrators or moderators for security
   * reasons. Validation rules enforce name uniqueness (within site context),
   * and update time is automatically stamped. If the specified category does
   * not exist or a naming conflict arises, appropriate error handling is
   * triggered.
   *
   * This endpoint fits into a typical CRUD suite for categories. It should be
   * used after category creation (`POST /discussionBoard/categories`) or
   * retrieval (`GET /discussionBoard/categories/{id}`) in an administrative
   * interface.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param id Unique identifier of the category to update.
   * @param body Category update payload following .IUpdate pattern.

  /**
   * Delete (soft-delete) a specific discussion board category
   * (discussion_board_categories).
   *
   * This API operation facilitates the deletion (soft-delete) of an existing
   * discussion board category. The endpoint interacts directly with the
   * `discussion_board_categories` table, enabling system administrators or
   * moderators to mark a category as deleted by setting the `deleted_at`
   * timestamp.
   *
   * This soft-delete pattern preserves historical data, allowing the
   * operation to be reversible by system administrators. It ensures that
   * user-generated content under this category is not removed but referenced
   * as belonging to a deleted category, which may affect user navigation and
   * administrative tasks. System logs and audit trails are updated as
   * required by compliance.
   *
   * If a category does not exist or is already deleted, appropriate error
   * messaging is enforced. This endpoint is used alongside category creation
   * and update operations for comprehensive lifecycle management.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param id UUID of the category to delete.
