   * Create a mention event (discussion_board_mentions table).

   * in a post/comment). Requires specifying both the actor (who mentions) and
   * the mentioned member, plus content type/id. On creation, triggers
   * notification flow if enabled. Business logic validates mentioned party
   * eligibility (e.g., not mentioning banned users), existence of content,
   * and actor permissions. On success, returns the new mention object. Action
   * is logged for notification/audit. Handles errors (400 for bad input, 403
   * for unauthorized mention, 404 for non-existent content/member). Designed
   * for in-thread/post commenting/conversation features needing mention
   * tracking and notification orchestration.

  /**
   * List/search mentions (discussion_board_mentions table) with advanced
   * criteria.
   *
   * This endpoint provides a paginated, filterable list of member mention
   * records. Users supply complex query/search criteria in the request body,
   * such as filtering mentions they received, sent, or by content type/id.
   * Pagination supports limit/offset or cursor-based pattern for scalable
   * queries in large datasets. Only authenticated users can search their own
   * mentions, while admin/moderators can search for any user for
   * moderation/audit. Results are sorted by recency by default, but may allow
   * sort overrides. Underlying logic ensures only allowed records are
   * revealed: members see only their mentions; moderators/admins see all for
   * compliance investigation. Validation is performed on filters and
   * pagination params. Any search criteria not met (invalid user,
   * out-of-range) are rejected. Errors handled include 400 for bad requests
   * and 403 for unauthorized access. Fulfills advanced query requirements for
   * notification/mentions UX.
