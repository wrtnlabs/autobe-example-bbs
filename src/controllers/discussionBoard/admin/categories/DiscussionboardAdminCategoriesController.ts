   * description.
   *
   * This endpoint supports UI scenarios where admins configure the

   * uniqueness and verifying that the optional parent_id, if used, refers to
   * an existing category.
   *
   * Upon success, the endpoint returns the new category object. If a name
   * collision or invalid parent_id is detected, an error is returned. All
   * creation events are logged in the audit system for compliance and
   * troubleshooting.

   * Enables administrative modification of an existing category identified by

   *
   * Permanently deletes a discussion board category from the database using

   * indicator, this operation performs a hard delete, removing the record
   * entirely and cascading as defined by the schema's referential integrity.
   *
   * Usage of this endpoint is restricted to admins. Deletion of a category
   * may affect related category_moderators, audit_logs, system_notices, and
   * topics due to cascading foreign key relationships. The operation must
   * fail with a clear error if the category is referenced by dependent
   * records that prevent deletion. All deletions should be fully audited for
   * accountability.
   *
   * Security and compliance: Hard delete is irreversible, so clients should
   * require confirmation. Any attempt to delete a non-existent or protected
   * category results in a 404 or permission-denied error.

   * @param connection
   * @param categoryId Unique identifier of the category to delete.
