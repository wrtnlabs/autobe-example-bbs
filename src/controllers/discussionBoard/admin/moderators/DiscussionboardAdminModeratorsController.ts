   * stores each moderator's role assignment, user identifier, grant and
   * revoke timestamps.

   * The endpoint provides a simple, non-paginated list of all moderators,

   * audits, or moderator management interfaces. Readers should be aware that
   * only admins or users with elevated privileges should have access to the
   * full list, as it may reveal role-grant history not meant for general
   * users.
   *
   * For compliance, the endpoint response includes only properties present in
   * the underlying schema. No historical or computed values beyond what
   * exists in the table are returned. This endpoint may be extended in future
   * versions to support filters or pagination, especially as the moderator
   * population grows.
