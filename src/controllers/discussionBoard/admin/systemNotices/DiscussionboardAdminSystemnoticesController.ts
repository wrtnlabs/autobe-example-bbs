   * List system notices (discussion_board_system_notices) with filtering and

   * Fetches a paginated list of all system-wide and per-category notices
   * present on the discussion board. Each system notice can be global
   * (applies to all categories) or tied to a specific category, according to
   * the schema.
   *
   * Only active notices are displayed to end-users, but admins and moderators
   * may list all notices, including inactive or scheduled future ones.
   * Results may be filtered by the status (is_active), scheduled dates
   * (start_at/end_at), category (by category_id), or by text search on title
   * and body fields, using trgm index as described for those columns.
   *
   * This endpoint integrates with the discussion_board_system_notices schema,
   * presenting each notice's id, category linkage (if any), title, body,
   * status, active periods, and timestamps. Supports pagination and basic
   * search features through query parameters or default settings.
   *
   * If the user is a guest, only public, currently active, scheduled notices
   * are returned. If the user is admin or moderator, the full set is
   * available.

   * Create a new system notice/announcement
   * (discussion_board_system_notices).
   *
   * Allows platform admins to create a new notice shown either globally or

   * discussion_board_system_notices schema. Input data includes title, body,
   * activation status, scheduling window (start_at, end_at, both optional),
   * category reference (optional), and timestamps are auto-set.
   *
   * On creation, the notice becomes visible to users depending on is_active
   * flag and scheduling (start_at/end_at). Category-limited notices target
   * only users in relevant category; global notices (category_id null) appear
   * on main board. Audit log updates are triggered (not shown here).
   *
   * Only administrators can invoke this endpoint; other roles are forbidden.

   *
   * Enables advanced searching and filtering of the board's system notices,

   * admins and moderators who need to perform complex queries on notices, for
   * instance, finding all expired, scheduled, or inactivated notices using
   * combination filters.
   *
   * The request body supports text search (trgm-based search on title and
   * body fields), filtering by is_active status, scheduled start and end
   * times, and category_id linkage. Results are paginated. This endpoint is
   * intended for backend management and dashboard data sources, providing
   * greater control over filtering than the standard GET.
   *
   * Extensive filtering is valuable for managing recurring banners, tracking
   * announcement history, or auditing scheduled system messages. Sensitive
   * notices (inactive, scheduled for future, or expired) are only listed for
   * authorized roles.
   *
   * Typical uses: Admin wants to view only currently scheduled (future)
   * notices or moderator reviews expired banners to plan reuse.
