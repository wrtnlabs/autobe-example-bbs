   * moderation actions or audit logs via UUID references, optimizing
   * workflows for content resolution or compliance tracking.
   *
   * A typical error case is requesting too many results or unauthorized
   * access, which returns a standard error and does not leak information
   * about specific reports.
   *
   * This endpoint may be used with PATCH /reports for advanced filtering, and
   * GET /reports/{reportId} for individual details.
