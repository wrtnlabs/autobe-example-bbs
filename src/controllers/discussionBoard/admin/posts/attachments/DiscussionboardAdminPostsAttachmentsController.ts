   * requires authenticated caller with appropriate permission, as enforced by
   * role and ownership logic in the application.

   * Permissible only for the original uploading member, moderators, or
   * admins. Request body defines which properties are updatable, and the
   * implementation respects strict adherence to fields in the
   * discussion_board_post_attachments schema, denying updates to immutable
   * fields (like uploaded timestamp). Errors are generated for attempts to
   * update non-existent or orphaned attachments, for unauthorized access, and
   * for immutable property updates.
   *
   * Enables correction of filenames, updates for replaced files, etc. A
   * successful update returns the full updated metadata.

   * @param postId Unique identifier of the post with the attachment.
   * @param attachmentId Unique identifier of the attachment to be updated.

   * The record is physically deleted from the database since the attachment
   * model does not support soft deletion in the Prisma schema. Depending on

   * post does not exist, access is denied, or if business rules (like locked

   * and logging layers as per compliance requirements.
