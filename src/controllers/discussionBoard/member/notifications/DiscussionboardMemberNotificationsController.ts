   * The operation is implemented over the discussion_board_notifications and
   * discussion_board_subscriptions tables. Filters and sorting are optimized
   * per index for delivery time and type. Error scenarios include
   * unauthorized access, invalid filters, or no results.
   *
   * Use in conjunction with PATCH /notifications for more complex search, or
   * GET /notifications/{notificationId} for single notification detail
   * retrieval.
