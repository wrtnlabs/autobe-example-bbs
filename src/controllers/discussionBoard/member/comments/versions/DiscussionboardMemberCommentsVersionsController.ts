   * (by member), timestamp of each version's creation, and content snapshot
   * per version. This enables members to review or roll back their own edits,

   * directly to the comment versioning mechanism described in the Prisma

   * discussion_board_comment_versions table. Error scenarios are handled for
   * cases where the comment does not exist, no versions are found, or the
