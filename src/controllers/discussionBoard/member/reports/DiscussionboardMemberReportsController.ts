   * Allows an authenticated member to submit a report about questionable or
   * abusive content. The operation validates required fields—such as
   * reporterId, content type, reported entity, and reason for the
   * report—before storing. All new reports default to 'pending' status for
   * review. Automated timestamping of creation supports audits and
   * follow-up.
   *
   * Only users with member, moderator, or admin roles may create reports
   * (guests cannot file complaints). Error scenarios include insufficient
   * permissions, attempts to double-report, or references to non-existent
   * content.
   *
   * Creation triggers notifications to moderators for review. Use GET or
   * PATCH endpoints to retrieve or review submitted reports.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Information required to create a new content report.
