   * requires unique username and email, with password provided as a properly
   * pre-hashed value by the presentation layer, which is never stored or
   * transmitted in plaintext. Upon registration, is_active can default as
   * enabled or require separate activation, depending on system policy.
   * Creation and update timestamps are recorded automatically, and soft
   * deletion status starts as null.
   *
   * Request body follows the 'ICreate' input contract, ensuring all database
   * integrity constraints (unique username/email, required fields, secure
   * password hash). Response includes all created user details except the
   * password hash (never exposed), aligning with privacy and security
   * standards.
   *
   * Upon success, user profile and role assignment endpoints can be used to
   * further configure the account. Error handling covers conflict (duplicate
   * username/email), invalid input data, and potential RBAC restrictions.

  /**

   * The PATCH /discussionBoard/users endpoint enables the retrieval of a

   * ('discussion_board_user'), fulfilling the requirements for user
   * management found in core functionality and administrative business
   * needs.

   * It references the 'discussion_board_user' Prisma table, allowing for
   * queries based on a user's username, email, activation status,

   * moderators typically use this endpoint to perform user account audits,
   * trend analysis, and onboarding checks.
   *
   * Security is critical and this endpoint should be restricted to users with
   * adequate administrative or moderation privileges, reflecting RBAC
   * (Role-Based Access Control) policies defined in policy docs. Use cases
   * include finding users by specific criteria, supporting mass actions via
   * user selection, and auditing platform growth.
   *
   * Expected request validation covers pagination (page, size), text search
   * (username, email), boolean filtering (is_active), temporal queries
   * (created_at, updated_at ranges), and status. Error handling includes
   * improper query structure, unauthorized access, and invalid filter
   * values.

   * Interoperates with the user creation, read, update, and delete endpoints,
   * and may be referenced after bulk moderation operations or role changes.
