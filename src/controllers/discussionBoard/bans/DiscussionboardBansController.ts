  /**
   * Create a new ban record (discussion_board_bans table) for a member.
   *
   * This endpoint allows an administrator or moderator to create a new ban
   * for a specific member.
   *
   * According to the discussion_board_bans table, each ban record requires
   * the member_id (target member's uuid), moderator_id (moderator/admin
   * uuid), ban_reason, permanent flag, created_at timestamp, and may
   * optionally include expires_at (for temp bans) and deleted_at (for
   * undo/audit). This operation must enforce permission checks so that only
   * authorized actors can perform bans. On ban creation, affected members may
   * be notified, and audit logs should record the action.
   *
   * Validation rules:
   *
   * - The member being banned must exist and not already have an active
   *   permanent ban.
   * - If the ban is not permanent, expires_at must be a future date.
   * - The moderator_id must reference a user with active moderator or admin
   *   role.
   *
   * Related APIs:
   *
   * - Use DELETE /discussionBoard/bans/{id} to lift/remove a ban.
   * - Use PUT /discussionBoard/bans/{id} to update ban details (e.g., change
   *   expiry).
   * - Use PATCH /discussionBoard/members to search for eligible members to
   *   ban/verify membership.
   *
   * All user-role permission checks, reason codes, and auditing must comply
   * with moderation and security sections of the requirements analysis and
   * table comments.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Payload to create a new ban. Contains member_id,
   *   moderator_id, ban_reason, permanent flag, created_at, and optional
   *   expires_at.
