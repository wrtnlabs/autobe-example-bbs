   * on active boards.
   *
   * Underlying data is drawn from discussion_board_threads, joined by topic
   * ID to filter the set. Only threads visible in the referenced topic (not

   * retrieval via /topics/{topicId}/threads/{threadId}.

   * if topic ID is invalid, with an empty result or error message per handler
   * logic. Useful for UI drill-down and thread activity displays.
