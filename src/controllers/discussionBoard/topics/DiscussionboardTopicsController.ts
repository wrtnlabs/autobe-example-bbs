   * Fetches a paginated list of active topics on the discussion board,
   * including their related categories and creator member information. This
   * operation is available to all users, including guests (read-only), as it
   * enables open browsing of public discussion topics per the requirements
   * analysis.
   *
   * Each item in the response summarizes a topic: its title, optional
   * description, pinned/closed flags, creation/update timestamps, and the
   * associated category. The underlying table is discussion_board_topics,
   * joined with discussion_board_categories for hierarchical browsing, and
   * discussion_board_members for audit trails.
   *
   * Security: As this endpoint is view-only and exposes public content, no
   * authentication or special permissions are required. Only topics intended
   * for participation (not deleted, not in restricted categories) are
   * visible. Error handling returns a paginated empty set if no topics exist.
   * Use in combination with /topics/{topicId} for full topic detail or to
   * drill into threads under a specific topic.
   *
   * Concurrency and consistency are managed at the database level; paginated
   * results may change as new topics are added or existing ones updated or
   * closed.

  /**
   * Search and filter topics on the discussion board with advanced criteria
   * (discussion_board_topics).
   *
   * Searches and retrieves discussion topics on the board using complex
   * filters such as category, pinned or closed status, date ranges, and text
   * queries. This operation allows both guests and authenticated users to
   * discover topics by more advanced criteria than simple listing.
   *
   * The search functionality is based on the discussion_board_topics table,
   * integrating joins to category and member tables for rich filtering and
   * faceted experiences. Pagination and sorting are fully supported.
   *
   * Security: As with the basic listing, no specific authentication is
   * required to search public topics. Sensitive or restricted categories
   * remain excluded from the public result set. The request body specifies
   * filter and sort criteria, and the paged result contains summary topic
   * information. Used jointly with GET /topics for initial load and GET
   * /topics/{topicId} for detail.
   *
   * Returns a paginated, filtered list, or an empty array if no results match
   * the query.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Search and filter parameters for topic lookup (category,
   *   title, status, paging, etc).
