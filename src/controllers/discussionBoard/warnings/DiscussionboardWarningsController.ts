   * moving from warning to ban after repeated offenses). The creation of a
   * warning triggers relevant notifications and can optionally reference
   * related moderation actions for full traceability. Proper validation is
   * enforced for user roles and foreign key integrity. Error handling is
   * included for invalid users or authorization issues. Closely related

   * user ban and moderation event logs.
