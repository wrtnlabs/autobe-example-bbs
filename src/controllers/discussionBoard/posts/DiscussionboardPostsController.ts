   * that the user is valid, and that all constraints are respected. On
   * successful creation, the response delivers the post record with full
   * relationship context for UI rendering or further processing. Edge cases
   * (invalid references, permission errors, duplicate/overposted content) are
   * handled by robust error responses.

   * input validation as per frontend/UX needs. Implements best practices for

   * certain age unless moderator). Validation includes checking thread and
