   * file uploaded alongside a post, ensuring every file is traceable by
   * uploader, MIME type, and timestamp. All items returned pertain solely to
   * the specified postId, preserving tight referential integrity as enforced
   * by the Prisma schema.

   * No authentication is required but authorization controls at the
   * application level should ensure that posts in restricted categories or
   * topics are not exposed to unauthorized users. Guest users may view
   * attachments so long as the post itself is public. Error handling ensures
   * that invalid postId values or attempts to access non-existent posts
   * result in a suitable error message and empty response.

   * or to power moderation dashboards for files.

  /**
   * Search/filter attachments on a post with advanced query/post filters

   * Enables efficient searching, filtering, and sorting of attachment records

   * by MIME type, file uploader, upload date range, or partial matches on
   * filenames—permitted by the system's attributes on
   * discussion_board_post_attachments.
   *
   * A comprehensive request body allows specification of pagination settings
   * and desired sort order, making it suitable for large posts with many
   * attachments. Authorization is similar to the simple GET: guests can
   * search attachments for public posts, but resource-sensitive validation
   * may restrict search capabilities depending on board or post privacy
   * level. The operation responds with a paginated array of simplified
   * attachment records, accompanied by pagination metadata.
   *
   * Integrates naturally with advanced UI, moderation panels, or admin tools
   * inspecting files uploaded to a given post.

   * @param connection
   * @param postId Unique identifier of the post whose attachments are being
