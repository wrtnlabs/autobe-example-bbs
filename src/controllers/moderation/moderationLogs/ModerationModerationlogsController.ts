   * contain all required details per the moderation_logs schema:
   * moderator_id, action_type, reason, and any related user, post, or comment
   * data. Validation checks ensure the requester has moderator/admin

   * Upon success, a new moderation_logs record is created and timestamped.
   * The action is available for auditing, dispute resolution, and

   * field consistency. Error handling covers field validation, permission
   * checks, and integrity errors. The response gives back the newly written
   * moderation log entry for further reference or review.
