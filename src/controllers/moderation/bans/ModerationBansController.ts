   * (moderator/admin) can ban, and that a user cannot have multiple active
   * bans. The conditions necessitating a ban (severe/spam/harassment etc.)

   * (update), and DELETE for individual bans.

   *   moderator, reason, and timestamps.

   * personal and sensitive data. Supports sorting by date issued, retrieval
   * by search strings (e.g., by username or email), and filtering by time
   * interval, moderator, or ban reason. This operation is typically
   * accompanied by other GET/PUT/DELETE endpoints for detailed view or
   * management of individual ban events. Errors return valid status codes and
   * descriptive messages.

   * @param body Filtering parameters for searching and paging through bans.
