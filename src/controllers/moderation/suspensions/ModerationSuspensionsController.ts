   * and precise starting and ending timestamps. Upon creation, the operation
   * logs the event (for audit, transparency, and legal compliance).

   * users are not authorized. The response returns the new suspension record
   * as confirmation, supporting subsequent retrieval, editing, or reporting.
   * Edge behavior: Overlapping suspensions for same user are discouraged or
   * flagged for review.
   *
   * @param body Information required to create a new suspension record.
