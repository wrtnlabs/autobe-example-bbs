   * it for moderation action. The request body must provide the reporting
   * user's ID, targeted post's ID, the report reason (e.g., spam, harassment,
   * off-topic), and other metadata required by the post_reports schema. The
   * system verifies existence and eligibility (the reporter is not already
   * restricted/banned, and the post exists/eligible).
   *
   * A new post_reports row is created, status set to 'pending', and
   * timestamped. The report becomes available to moderators/admins for
   * workflow triage. Subsequent endpoints handle inspection (GET), bulk
   * listing (PATCH), escalation, or resolution (PUT). Error handling covers
   * invalid data, unauthorized reporters, or duplicate report rules.
   *
   * @param body New post report details: reporter_id, post_id, reason, etc.

   * single report detail, PUT to update, DELETE (if allowed) for removal.
