   * (optionally) related post/comment. This formally documents a moderation
   * warning, alerts the user, and becomes part of the user’s moderation
   * history. Input validation ensures entities exist and required information
   * is included.
   *
   * Operation restricted to users with moderator or administrator role by
   * RBAC logic. After creation, the issued warning can trigger user
   * notifications (see notifications tables). Follow-up actions may include
   * PUT to adjust/resolve or DELETE to remove mistaken records. All warning
   * creations should be reflected in moderation_logs for
   * transparency/compliance.

  /**
   * List and search user_warnings rows for moderation, using user_warnings
   * table.
   *
   * Enables moderators and administrators to access a filtered and paginated
   * listing of user warnings from the user_warnings table. This is key in
   * enforcing escalating moderation actions as outlined in content rules and
   * business policies. Data returned may be filtered by user, moderator,
   * post, comment, status, or date/time, supporting moderation dashboard
   * review.
   *
   * Sensitive access is RBAC-restricted. User warning records support
   * metrics, individual case review, and aggregate user moderation history
   * analysis.
   *
   * Pagination, sorting, and search criteria must be handled to optimize
   * performance and avoid large response payloads. In typical workflows, a
   * moderator may list warnings to decide if further action is warranted
   * (e.g., suspension/ban).
   *
   * Preceding or related calls might include user-case GET, POST to issue
   * warning, PUT/DELETE to update or remove warning records. Error cases
   * include permission denial or invalid filters.
   *
   * @param body Filter and pagination parameters for searching user warnings.
