   * comments. Request validation includes ensuring the reporter is a
   * registered user and that provided data such as comment ID and report
   * reason are complete and valid.
   *
   * Post-submission, moderators are notified to review and act on the new
   * report as per moderation workflow. Duplicate reporting protections and
   * abuse rate limits may apply. Upon creation, a reference to the new report
   * is returned for tracking, and moderators can subsequently use
   * GET/PUT/DELETE endpoints for follow-up.
   *
   * Error handling covers non-existent target comments, malformed requests,
   * and lack of authentication. Proper audit logging is recommended for
   * transparency.

  /**
   * List and search comment_reports entries for moderation, backed by
   * comment_reports table.
   *
   * This endpoint is used to retrieve a list of comment reports from the
   * comment_reports table with advanced filtering, pagination, and optional
   * sorting. The ability to search by status, creation/resolution date,
   * reporter, or comment target enhances moderation workflows.
   *
   * Only moderators and admins can access this operation due to the sensitive
   * nature of reported content, enforced via RBAC using roles and
   * role_assignments tables. Pagination and limit parameters prevent
   * excessive result sets and performance bottlenecks.
   *
   * Common usages include displaying an inbox of pending reports, tracking
   * resolution metrics, or auditing moderator actions. Filtered access helps
   * prioritize high-severity reports.
   *
   * Dependency: Moderators often fetch the list before acting on individual
   * reports (using GET/PUT/DELETE by ID endpoints). Error handling covers
   * insufficient permissions and invalid filter syntax.
   *
   * @param body Request filtering, pagination, and sorting options for
