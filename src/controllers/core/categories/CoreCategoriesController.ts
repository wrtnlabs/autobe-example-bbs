  /**
   * List and search categories (Core.categories).
   *
   * This API operation returns a list of categories, leveraging the
   * 'categories' table from the database.
   *
   * The response is paginated and may be filtered based on optional query
   * parameters such as name, partial matches in description, or created_at
   * window. Secure endpoints may restrict certain filters or result fields to
   * administrators. The main purpose is to allow users to browse or search
   * available discussion categories for post assignment or exploration.
   *
   * Security: Some filtering/search options may be restricted to users with
   * elevated roles, such as administrators or moderators. Regular users
   * typically see all active categories only.
   *
   * This endpoint is commonly used in category selection modals,
   * administrative dashboards, and on board homepages. Validation ensures
   * page and pageSize are non-negative, and sortBy field must match a valid
   * column. Error handling will return informative failures for invalid
   * filter parameters or database errors.
   *
   * This operation is related to single-category get, create, update, and
   * delete operations, and in large systems may be supplemented by category
   * suggestion/approval flows.

   * @param body Search criteria, pagination, and sorting parameters for
   *   categories list query.
