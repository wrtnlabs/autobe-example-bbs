   * Create a new user role assignment (role_assignments table).

   * This endpoint assigns a user to a role by creating a new
   * 'role_assignments' record, following strict normalization as shown in the
   * Prisma schema. Its use case is granting moderator/admin access or
   * standard onboarding workflows. Data includes the user ID, role ID, and
   * assignment timestamp. Duplicate assignments (same user/role) are rejected
   * with an error, as the combination is uniquely constrained in the DB.
   *
   * Security is enforced—only admins may access. All assignments are logged
   * for audit compliance. Errors include uniqueness violations, permission
   * denials, and missing referenced users or roles. Upon successful creation,
   * the exact assignment record is returned.
   *
   * Each assignment can later be updated or deleted using the corresponding
   * endpoints. Related endpoints involve listing, detail retrieval, update,
   * and delete for role assignments.
   *
   * @param body Data for creating a user role assignment (user ID, role ID).

  /**
   * List/search user role assignments (role_assignments table).
   *
   * This endpoint retrieves a (possibly paginated and filtered) list of role
   * assignments that link users to roles in the 'role_assignments' table.
   * Used for administrative review, bulk role management, or audit trailing.
   * Supports query parameters or request body filters such as user ID, role
   * ID, assignment range, and sorting preferences. Each assignment includes
   * the user and role reference, with joined data when needed.
   *
   * Security is strict: only admins (and possibly moderators, if business
   * rules allow) may use this operation. Output is paginated for scalability,
   * and can be sorted by assignment date or related user/role fields. Error
   * responses account for invalid filters, missing resources, or permission
   * denials. Related endpoints are single record view, assignment creation,
   * update, and deletion.
   *
   * The endpoint references the strong normalization principles of the Prisma
   * schema—no redundant details, referential integrity maintained. Any query
   * performance considerations should be addressed for potentially large
   * datasets.

   * @param body Query and filter info for role assignments list.
