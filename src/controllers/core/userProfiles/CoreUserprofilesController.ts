   * is a 1:1 extension of 'users'. This API is designed for admin/moderator
   * UI, community statistics, or advanced search scenarios.

   * records. Data complies with privacy and business rules.
   *
   * Supports pagination and sorting. Related APIs: get, create, update,

   * be further linked to posts, comments, etc.

   * @param body Search query and pagination information for profiles.

   * Deletes the profile record from user_profiles table for the given profile
