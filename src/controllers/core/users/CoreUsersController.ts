   * user accounts. It accepts all required and optional fields per the users
   * model: username, email, bio (optional), status, and an associated
   * user_role_id. Passwords are securely hashed before saving, never stored
   * in plain text.
   *
   * Unique constraints are enforced for both username and email to prevent
   * duplicates. The user role must point to an existing role defined in
   * user_roles. Timestamps for creation and update are handled automatically.
   * Successful creation returns the newly registered user's public profile
   * and role association (never the password hash).
   *
   * Security and validation reflect business rules, e.g., email visibility,
   * profile privacy, and initial status setting. Input errors or duplicates
   * return clear messages and codes. Related endpoints: list (PATCH), read
   * (GET), update (PUT), delete (DELETE).

   * Retrieve a paginated, filterable list of users (core.users table).

   * This operation returns a paginated and filtered list of users registered
   * on the discussion board. Users may be searched by username, email, user
   * role, or status, and results are sorted and paginated according to the
   * provided parameters. The endpoint refers to the users table, whose
   * structure includes fields for username, email, bio, role reference,
   * password hash, timestamps, and status. Filters can help administrators or
   * moderators locate specific accounts, monitor new signups, or audit
   * activity. Security is enforced: only users with moderator or
   * administrator roles can access or use advanced filters.
   *
   * The endpoint applies business rules from the requirements, such as hiding
   * sensitive (e.g., password) information, and supports relations to
   * user_roles for displaying or filtering by user type. Pagination and
   * sorting follow best practices for usability and performance. Related
   * endpoints: create (POST), retrieve detail (GET), update (PUT), and delete
   * (DELETE) for users.
   *
   * Error handling ensures invalid queries, unauthorized access, or database
   * issues are managed gracefully, returning clear status codes and messages.
