   * security (hashing, not storing plaintext).
   *
   * Security: Only open to unauthenticated users (for self-registration) or

   *
   * Validation: Email format check, password strength requirements, and
   * conflict handling for existing emails.

   * expected/created in user_profiles for the user. Soft-deletion and audit
   * trails apply on the 'users' table.
   *
   * Related endpoints: User detail, update, deletion. Role assignment handled

  /**
   * List users with full search and pagination (users table).
   *
   * This operation retrieves a paginated, searchable, and sortable list of
   * user accounts from the 'users' table. The underlying Prisma schema
   * describes 'users' as the root entity for community membership, storing
   * information like email, hashed password, and creation date. User roles
   * and permissions depend on entries in the 'role_assignments' table, but
   * each entry here represents a unique account.
   *
   * Security considerations: Only users with admin or moderator roles can
   * access this list, as it may contain sensitive details (e.g., presence of
   * deleted accounts). The list includes both active and soft-deleted
   * accounts, with deletion status indicated by 'deleted_at'.
   *
   * For validation: Query parameters support pagination (e.g., page, limit),
   * search filters (e.g., by email or registration date), and sorting (e.g.,
   * by created_at desc, email asc). Business logic ensures only authorized
   * users can retrieve this information. Related endpoints are the user
   * detail, creation, update, and deletion APIs.
   *
   * Related API: Each user in the returned list can be accessed in detail via
   * 'GET /core/users/{id}'. Creation, update, and delete operations are
   * handled elsewhere.
