   * Create a new role (roles table) for RBAC management.
   *
   * This endpoint allows administrators to define new roles for permission
   * management, supporting RBAC (role-based access control) as outlined in
   * the platform's business rules and moderation workflows. The 'roles' table
   * ensures each role name is unique. The creation payload should include the
   * 'name' and 'description' fields, implementing normalization principles
   * from the Prisma schema. Security measures should restrict this operation
   * to admin users only. If a duplicate name is provided, an appropriate
   * error should be raised. Related endpoints include updating and deleting
   * roles. Operation returns the created role object, or an error if creation
   * fails due to validation or uniqueness constraints.
   *
   * Admins leverage this operation during system setup or to introduce new
   * access levels as the platform evolves. Post-creation, roles can be
   * assigned to users via the role assignment endpoints. Error handling
   * includes validation for required fields, database errors, and permission
   * checks. Logs should record who created the role for audit purposes.
   *
   * Errors and success responses must be clearly defined, ensuring
   * administrative actions are transparent and reversible if necessary.
   *
   * @param body Payload to create a new role, including name and description.

  /**
   * Update an existing role by ID (roles table).
   *
   * This endpoint allows an admin to update the properties (such as the name
   * and description) of an existing RBAC role using its unique ID. The
   * operation is grounded in the 'roles' table as described in the Prisma
   * schema, with strong normalization discipline on role identification.
   * Validation rules require that the role exists, and that any updated
   * 'name' remains unique across the table. This operation is essential for
   * administrative maintenance and adapts the system to evolving requirements
   * or refined role definitions.
   *
   * Role updates are performed via a JSON request body mirroring
   * 'IRole.IUpdate', typically providing the new name and/or description. The
   * update is logged for audit purposes. Security is enforced: only admin
   * users may access. Validations include null checks, duplicate name checks,
   * and verifying whether the ID exists. Error handling must deliver clear
   * messages for not found and uniqueness violations.
   *
   * Related endpoints include role creation and deletion. RBAC logic ensures
   * that updates do not inadvertently escalate privileges beyond
   * admin-controlled workflows.
