   * This API endpoint allows an administrator to remove an organization entry

   * potential future features related to organizational roles or permissions.
   * Deleting an organization will disassociate all users and roles from the
   * organization but must ensure referential integrity is preserved
   * throughout the system.
   *
   * Before deleting an organization, the system must validate that the
   * organization exists and check for any dependencies, such as users
   * assigned exclusively to this organization, which may require reassignment
   * or further validation. Only users with administrative privileges should
   * be allowed to perform this operation, and all deletions should be soft
   * deletions to support auditability and potential recovery, according to
   * GDPR and business requirements.
   *
   * Attempting to delete a non-existent organization should return an
   * appropriate error message. This endpoint is related to other organization
   * management APIs, like creation and update. Deletion actions should be
   * logged and subject to the same audit controls described in site and
   * moderation settings.
