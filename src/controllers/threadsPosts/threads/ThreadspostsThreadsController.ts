   * includes the thread title, category ID, and initial tag assignments. The
   * creator is set to the authenticated user.
   *
   * Upon creation, the system must validate category existence, uniqueness of
   * the title within the category, and appropriate permissions. The creation
   * timestamp and other metadata are set by the system. Newly created threads
   * are not locked or pinned by default. Successful operation returns the
   * created thread data. Audit logging of thread creation, including user ID
   * and IP address, supports transparency. Related APIs include update, list,
   * and delete endpoints for threads.

   * @param body Data required for creating a new thread.

   * search, category and tag filters, sorting (by date, votes, etc.), and
   * pagination controls.
   *
   * Threads are the main grouping unit for posts and discussions, each
   * associated with a category and set of tags. The response should include
   * basic thread information (ID, title, category, pinned/locked status,
   * created/updated time) as well as metadata for client pagination.
   *
   * Security: Even unauthenticated users may view thread lists, but hidden or
   * deleted threads should be omitted or filtered according to user role and
   * soft deletion status. Moderation status may affect visibility. Validation
   * logic includes enforcing page size limits. This operation is closely
   * coordinated with thread detail, create, and update operations.
