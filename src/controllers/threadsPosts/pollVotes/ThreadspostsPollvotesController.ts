   * Create a new poll vote (threadsPosts/poll_votes table).

   * POST /threadsPosts/pollVotes allows a registered user to submit a vote on
   * a poll using the 'poll_votes' Prisma schema. The request body is
   * IThreadsPostsPollVote.ICreate, which should include poll_id,
   * poll_option_id, and user_id (typically inferred from
   * authentication/token).
   *
   * Business logic ensures only one vote per user per pollâ€”the operation
   * checks for duplicates and rejects if one exists. Voting is only allowed
   * when the poll is open (date logic), and results may be hidden until the
   * poll closes per requirements. The created vote record is returned upon
   * success.
   *
   * Security: Only registered users can vote. The endpoint validates poll and
   * option existence and user permissions.
   *
   * @param body Details of the poll vote (poll_id, poll_option_id, user_id).
