   * Create a new post edit snapshot in the 'post_edits' table after editing

   * represent a snapshot/version of a post after it is edited. According to
   * the schema, this must include the current title, body, the ID of the user
   * performing the edit (author or moderator), the post ID, a reason for the
   * edit, and the editor's IP address. Success returns the stored record for
   * immediate confirmation and UI update. On validation error (e.g., missing
   * fields, auth failure) returns an error. Access control must ensure only
   * the post owner, a moderator, or an admin can create an edit history. This
   * endpoint is closely linked with post update workflows, where every
   * in-place edit is accompanied by such a snapshot for evidentiary and
   * roll-back reasons.
   *
   * @param body Information for the new post edit snapshot, including post
   *   ID, new content, editor, and reason for the edit.

   * This 'get' operation returns the full details of a specific post edit
   * record from the 'post_edits' table, identified by its unique ID

   * snapshot of the post's title and body at a specific revision point, along

   * timestamp. This is essential for audit trails and supports transparency,

   * history, the endpoint should be restricted to authorized users (e.g., the
   * original author, moderators, or admins per business rules). Returns null
   * or an error if the record does not exist or the user is unauthorized.
   * This endpoint is related to the overall post edit workflow: edits are
   * created with the POST operation, and histories are fetched with this GET;
   * full post histories may require aggregation at the thread or post level
   * via related APIs.
