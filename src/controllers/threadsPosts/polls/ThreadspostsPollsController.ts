   *   open/close dates, poll options list, etc.

  /**
   * Update a specific poll in the threadsPosts (polls table).
   *
   * The PUT /threadsPosts/polls/{id} endpoint enables modification of an
   * existing poll within the discussion board's threadsPosts subsystem. It
   * references the 'polls' Prisma model, which contains atomic fields such as
   * question, start_at, and end_at.
   *
   * Security: Only users with appropriate permissions (poll creator or
   * moderators) can perform this operation. Attempts to update with invalid
   * or past-close-date timestamps are rejected per business logic. The
   * operation validates referential integrity, ensuring the poll belongs to a
   * valid post and that date updates do not violate poll status constraints.
   *
   * Business logic: On editing, a history/audit log may be triggered (not
   * stored in the poll directly). The endpoint never creates new polls—it
   * acts exclusively on the identified poll by its id parameter. If the poll
   * does not exist, or is soft-deleted, the operation fails with appropriate
   * error messaging. Related endpoints include creation (POST
   * /threadsPosts/polls), retrieval (GET), and deletion (DELETE
   * /threadsPosts/polls/{id}).
   *
   * Error handling ensures that attempts to alter immutable fields or perform
   * partially invalid updates result in descriptive error responses.

   * @param id Unique identifier of the poll to update
   * @param body Fields to update for the poll (question, dates).

  /**
   * Delete a specific poll from the threadsPosts (polls table).

   * DELETE /threadsPosts/polls/{id} allows a user or moderator to permanently

   * ensures robust permission checks—only the poll's creator or moderators
   * can delete polls. Deletion typically cascades to associated poll_options
   * and poll_votes due to Prisma's relational modeling.
   *
   * Special care is taken to enforce audit logging: every deletion is
   * reported in the moderation logs for transparency and future appeals.
   * Delets are generally logical (soft-delete) unless otherwise specified by
   * business policy, preserving historical evidence as required by moderation
   * rules.
   *
   * The operation will fail gracefully if the poll does not exist, already
   * deleted, or the user is unauthorized. Related endpoints include updating
   * (PUT), retrieval (GET), and creation (POST) of polls.
