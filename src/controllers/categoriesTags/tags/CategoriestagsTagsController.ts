   * unique, normalized, and meets system business rules as enforced by the
   * Prisma 'tags' schema (unique constraint on 'name').
   *
   * On success, it returns the complete tag object, including id and

   * handling includes duplicate names and format issues. The feature is

   * curation.

  /**
   * Retrieves a paginated, filtered list of tags from the 'tags' Prisma table
   * for advanced thread filtering.
   *
   * This endpoint allows clients to retrieve an indexed list of all available
   * tags for labeling and filtering threads. Each tag is represented by
   * unique, normalized attributes (id, name, created_at) from the Prisma
   * 'tags' schema. The endpoint supports flexible search through keyword
   * queries on tag names and advanced filtering by creation date. Sorting by
   * name or newest/oldest is supported for optimal UI/UX in tag pickers.
   *
   * This design follows strict 3NF normalization, ensuring that no duplicate
   * or aggregated tag information is returned—each tag is atomic. Security is
   * generally open to authenticated users, but pagination and rate limiting
   * prevent abuse, especially in large-scale deployments. If business rules
   * grant tag management only to admins/moderators, results can be restricted
   * accordingly.
   *
   * The endpoint returns a paginated structure with total counts and current
   * page details. It's closely related to the tag creation and update
   * endpoints, as well as thread-tag management operations. Robust error
   * handling for malformed queries or filter/sort misuse is essential. This
   * endpoint powers tag search/autocomplete UI in thread creation/edit forms
   * and supports community-driven topic curation.
   *
   * @param body Flexible parameters for searching, filtering, and sorting
   *   tags, along with pagination controls.
