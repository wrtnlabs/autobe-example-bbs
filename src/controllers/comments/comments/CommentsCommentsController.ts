   * Create a new comment/reply (comments table, POST).

   * post, or as a reply to another comment (threading). The operation uses
   * atomic, strictly normalized fields including post_id, author_id,
   * parent_id (nullable), and the required comment content. Backend applies
   * permission and anti-abuse logic (e.g., rate limits, posting
   * restrictions).
   *
   * Data validation follows the Prisma schema and business rules: content
   * cannot be empty, and references must exist (valid post_id, optional but
   * valid parent_id, etc.). Returned object contains all core properties and
   * references. Upon success, returns the full comment. Errors include
   * invalid input, auth failure, or attempts to reply to
   * deleted/comment-locked threads/comments.
   *
   * @param body Comment creation info (target post, parent comment, content,
   *   author).

  /**
   * List and search comments (comments table, PATCH).
   *
   * This operation allows authenticated users to retrieve a list of comments
   * from the 'comments' table. The endpoint supports searching by various
   * criteria (e.g., post_id, author_id), pagination (offset/limit or
   * page/size), and sorting (e.g., by created_at, by most upvotes). All
   * comments maintain atomicity, threading reference, audit fields, and
   * possible parent_id for nested replies. The operation enforces permission
   * checks in the backend (e.g., filter out soft-deleted comments for regular
   * users but allow moderators to view all).
   *
   * Request body fields include page/limit, filter conditions, and sort mode.
   * All query behaviors are strongly based on the Prisma schema and
   * requirements for transparent, normalized retrieval. System logs queries
   * for audit and system performance monitoring.
   *
   * Related operations: - GET /comments/comments/{id} to fetch single comment
   * details, and POST /comments/comments to create a new comment.
   *
   * Error cases include: invalid parameters, unauthorized access, or query
   * errors. The request body must be shaped as per the 'IComment.IRequest'
   * definition from OpenAPI components.
   *
   * @param body Comment list retrieval/query parameters (search, pagination,
   *   filters).
