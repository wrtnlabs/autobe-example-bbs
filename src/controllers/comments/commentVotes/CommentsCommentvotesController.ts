  /**
   * Create a comment vote (upvote/downvote) for a specific comment
   * (comment_votes table).
   *
   * This API operation allows a registered user to cast an upvote or downvote
   * on a specific comment. The comment_votes table tracks each atomic vote
   * action, ensuring that a user may only vote once per comment (unique per
   * user and comment_id). When this endpoint is called, the system checks
   * that the user is authenticated and possesses the necessary permissions
   * (not banned/suspended). The API validates that the target comment exists
   * and is enabled for voting.
   *
   * The request body must contain identifiers for the comment and user, along
   * with the direction of the vote (upvote or downvote). Upon successful
   * creation, a new comment_votes record is written, timestamped, and
   * included in reputation/aggregation logic elsewhere (not here). If a vote
   * already exists for this user-comment pair, an error is returned, and
   * users are directed to the update or delete endpoints for changes.
   *
   * Security is enforced through user authentication tokens and permission
   * checks (users cannot vote on their own comments if business rules dictate
   * so). This operation may trigger notifications or UI updates. The API is
   * tightly coupled with the comment_votes model and is part of essential
   * functionality for social engagement and ranking within threads.
   *
   * @param body Information for creating a new comment vote: must include
   *   comment_id, voter_id, and is_upvote.

   * one-to-one mapping per (user, comment): thus, only the owning user may
   * change their vote's direction via this endpoint. The request body must

   * is stored for the modification. This endpoint enforces all business
   * rulesâ€”such as not allowing admins/moderators to override regular users'
   * votes, and preventing edits during suspensions or bans. Audit and
   * moderation logs reflect this action. The updated comment vote is returned
   * on success. Errors are produced for not found, ownership mismatch, or

   * the vote, or an admin in moderation circumstances, may remove the
   * comment_votes record. Upon API call, the system confirms the vote exists,
   * that the calling user is authorized, and that the comment and user
   * association matches the record.
   *
   * Once validated, the vote is deleted (physically or via soft-delete
   * depending on business rules/audit requirements), ensuring one user can
   * have at most one active vote per comment. Deletions are tracked in audit
   * logs for moderation and transparency. The deletion can impact reputation
   * scoring or vote totals, but those are managed elsewhere. If the vote does
   * not exist, or authorization fails, the API returns appropriate errors.
