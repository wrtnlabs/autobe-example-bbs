   * Creates a record for managing per-user preferences and settings such as
   * language selection, theme (light/dark), notification types/frequency
   * (JSON), and accessibility options (JSON). This operation references the
   * Prisma user_settings table and follows strict business logic to enforce
   * only one record per user (1:1 relationship, unique user_id).
   *
   * Typically used during user registration or when a user customizes their
   * account preferences for the first time. Admins can also create settings
   * for users in support flows. The API requires all atomic, normalized input
   * fields specified in the schema.
   *
   * Related endpoints for retrieval, modification, or deletion are
   * /settings/userSettings PATCH/GET/PUT/DELETE. Errors arise on violation of
   * unique user_id, missing required fields, or unauthorized creation by
   * non-owners/admins.
   *
   * @param body Inputs for creation of a user-specific settings record.

   * model.

   * Access may be restricted to the currently authenticated user (for their
