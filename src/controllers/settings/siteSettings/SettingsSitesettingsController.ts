   * Create new site_settings record (Prisma: site_settings).
   *
   * This endpoint creates a new global site settings record for the board. It
   * is intended for system bootstrap and initial configuration or when
   * resetting all board-wide settings due to policy change, migration, or
   * major update.
   *
   * Typically, only one active site_settings record is allowed, and duplicate
   * creation should be guarded by business logic and unique site_name
   * constraint. Only administrators are permitted to call this API, ensuring
   * secure and controlled platform configuration management. This operation
   * references the site_settings model in the Prisma schema and validates
   * that all settings fields (site name, language, guidelines URL, branding
   * logo, features JSON, etc.) are atomic, non-derived values stored
   * centrally.
   *
   * If the site is already configured, subsequent requests may be rejected to
   * prevent ambiguity in platform configuration. Error handling should
   * include checks for missing required fields or conflicts with existing
   * settings.
   *
   * Related endpoints for updating/deleting settings are
   * /settings/siteSettings/{id} PUT/DELETE. For per-user settings, use
   * /settings/userSettings.
   *
   * @param body Site-wide configuration details to create a new settings
   *   record.

   * the site_settings schema, requiring only atomic, non-derived fields to be

   * DELETE for deletion.
