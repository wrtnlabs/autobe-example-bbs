   * to moderation or review depending on platform policies.

   * Input validation includes ensuring a valid category reference,

   * success, the API returns the full details of the created post, including
   * assigned UUID, timestamps, and author/category references.
   *
   * Error cases include missing/invalid data, attempts to create a post in
   * non-existent category, or by unauthorized/blocked users. Related

   * plus comment APIs.

   * see only non-deleted, non-archived posts, while administrators may have

   * for page, pageSize, and sort field inputs.
   *
   * The endpoint supports community browsing, category threads,
   * author-centric feeds, and search result pages. It also includes support
   * for keyword-based full-text search on titles and content. Additional
   * metadata such as comment and vote counts may be included per business
   * requirements. Error handling addresses invalid filters, missing results,
   * or backend errors.
