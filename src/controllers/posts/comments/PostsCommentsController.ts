   * Create a new comment (Posts domain, 'comments' table).

   * fields include the content, target postId, and optionally a parentId (for
   * replies-to-replies).
   *
   * Input is validated for minimum/maximum length, appropriate content, and
   * ensuring the parent exists and belongs to the same post. The endpoint
   * checks author authentication and standard anti-abuse policies (e.g., rate
   * limiting). On success, it returns the created comment record with all
   * metadata (author, timestamp, etc.).
   *
   * Business logic from the 'comments' table (Posts domain) is implemented:
   * only registered users may comment; soft deletion rules apply. Related
   * endpoints: retrieval (GET /posts/comments/{id}), update (PUT
   * /posts/comments/{id}), and listing (PATCH /posts/comments).
   *
   * @param body New comment data, including content, postId, and optional
   *   parentId.

   * Retrieve a filtered, paginated list of comments (Posts domain, 'comments'

   * Typically, users or moderators use it to see all comments on a specific

   * activity.
   *
   * The route supports filtering (e.g., by postId, userId, parentId),
   * pagination (offset/limit), full-text search on comment content, and
   * sorting (e.g., newest first). Security considerations include only
   * exposing non-deleted comments by default, unless requested by a

   * inappropriate language if the requester has insufficient privileges.

   * optimized via relevant indexes. Related APIs include: create (POST
   * /posts/comments), update (PUT /posts/comments/{id}), retrieve detail (GET
   * /posts/comments/{id}), and delete (DELETE /posts/comments/{id}).
   *
   * Input validation includes correct types for filters, max page size, and
   * valid sort orders. Error handling covers unauthorized access, malformed
   * filters, and nonexistent references.

   * @param body Defines filtering, pagination, and sorting criteria for
   *   retrieving comments. Fields may include postId, userId, parentId,
