   * This endpoint provides a paginated and searchable list of teachers from
   * the attendance_teacher table. It enables filtering by school, name, or
   * email as needed for school dashboards, admin management, and role
   * assignment. The API supports pagination (limit/offset), search term for
   * name or email, sorting by creation/update date, and additional filters as
   * desired (e.g., by school_id). This operation is secured by role-based
   * access control: only admin and teacher roles may call this endpoint.
   * Input validation ensures only valid filter parameters are accepted. If
   * search yields no results, an empty list is returned with pagination info.
   * For related context, use POST for creation, PUT for update, and DELETE
   * for removal.
