   * Create a new attendance notification event (attendance_notification
   * table).
   *
   * This API operation is used to post (create) a new attendance notification
   * in the attendance_notification table, reflecting an event that is to
   * trigger communication toward guardians (parents), admins, or other
   * monitoring roles. The operation requires the caller to specify all
   * mandatory atomic fields—attendance_record_id (what event this is for),
   * student_id (who it pertains to), classroom_id (which group/class),
   * event_type (present, absent, late, leave, etc.), triggered_at (when the
   * notification event was generated), and message_template (the canonical or
   * customized message for the notification). Optionally, teacher_id can be
   * specified if the notification resulted from a teacher's manual action.
   * This endpoint enforces normalized storage (never aggregates per delivery
   * channel) and is directly linked via FK to notification histories and
   * channels for actual delivery attempts/logging. Only authorized users
   * (teachers for their students; admins for their school/unit) can invoke
   * this function. Validation includes referential integrity checks for all
   * provided IDs, input length/range validation (e.g., for message template),
   * and legal status checks (e.g., no duplicate for the same attendance
   * record and event_type). Error handling covers privilege errors,
   * referential integrity failures, or unexpected system states. Upon
   * success, the created notification is returned; automated delivery to
   * channels may follow as a background job or be explicitly triggered via
   * secondary endpoints.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body New notification event atomic info, referencing student,
   *   attendance record, classroom, message, and optional teacher.

  /**
   * Fetch a single attendance notification event by ID
   * (attendance_notification table).
   *
   * This API operation fetches a single attendance notification based on its
   * system-unique identifier, as defined in the attendance_notification
   * table. The notification contains the core event data: which student and
   * classroom it references, who (if any) triggered the event (such as a
   * teacher), the event type (present, absent, late, leave), the exact time
   * it was triggered, and the associated message template intended for
   * parent/authority communication. The attendance_notification record is
   * strictly normalized, referencing atomically the relevant attendance
   * record, student, teacher (if applicable), and classroom, without
   * containing denormalized or aggregated data from any join. The API
   * enforces strict access controls so that: 1) Teachers can only fetch
   * notifications issued for their own classes/students; 2) Parents can only
   * access notifications regarding their child(ren); 3) Administrators and
   * authorized officials may retrieve any notification within their
   * jurisdiction. The API robustly returns appropriate error responses for
   * requests for records outside the authorized scope, for deleted/expired
   * IDs, or malformed requests. Related notification history and channel
   * information for this notification are accessed via their own endpoints
   * but may be referenced in the response. This endpoint is often used in
   * parent-facing notification detail screens, admin audits, or incident
   * response workflows.

   * Update an existing attendance notification event

   *
   * This API operation allows updating a single attendance notification's
   * atomic event fields, as represented in the attendance_notification table.
   * The operation requires the caller to specify the notification ID (UUID,
   * path parameter) and a payload (normalized and atomic) specifying only the
   * fields to be updated—such as event_type, triggered_at, message_template,
   * teacher_id, or classroom_id. Restrictions are enforced so that delivery
   * attempts, channel history, and delivery status are immutable via this
   * endpoint; changes here affect only the master event record's content
   * (used for subsequent or corrected notifications). Strict referential
   * integrity must be checked for all updated FKs, and policy-enforced
   * constraints are applied for event_type and allowed editing windows (e.g.,
   * after delivery, editing may be restricted). Role-based permissions
   * dictate that only the originating teacher (for their own classes) or
   * admins (systemwide) may update notification events, with all changes
   * appended to the audit log. Proper error responses are returned for
   * privilege failures, missing/invalid IDs, or business logic violations.
