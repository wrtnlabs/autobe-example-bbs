  /**
   * Creates a new attendance_notification_history record in the database.
   *
   * This API endpoint allows the system to log a new delivery event for a
   * notification sent to parents, teachers, or admins. As described in the
   * Prisma schema: each record must store the foreign keys to the
   * notification (attendance_notification), the channel used for delivery
   * (attendance_notification_channel), the expected or actual sent/delivered
   * timestamps, delivery status (e.g., pending, delivered, failed), and any
   * error message returned from the channel provider. This is crucial for
   * post-event auditing and troubleshooting delivery issues.
   *
   * Permission checks must ensure that notification and channel refs are
   * valid and that only authorized system roles (notification relay/process
   * runners, not students or parents) are allowed to invoke this operation.
   * Error handling follows the schema: failing on missing required FK,
   * invalid statuses, or business rule violations (e.g., duplicate log for
   * same notification+channel+timestamp).
   *
   * Related API operations may include querying notification history (for
   * notification status dashboards or parent/teacher review) and bulk log
   * import (for external relay integration).

   * @param connection
   * @param body Delivery attempt/result info of the notification history
   *   event.

   * This API operation lists or searches notification delivery attempt

   * filter by notification_id, channel_id/type, recipient, delivery status,

   * compliance audit logs. Access is restricted to owners (for their events)
   * or admin (full scope). Errors are returned on access failure, invalid
   * filters, or paging issues. Standard pagination is always present (page,

   * consumption by client UIs.
