   * This endpoint allows the creation of a new school in the attendance
   * system, as required by the administrator interface for school management
   * (see 06_attendance_admin_page.md). The input must include atomic,
   * normalized school properties, specifically the school name and address.
   * These fields must be validated for uniqueness at the database level to
   * prevent the registration of duplicate schools. The operation is
   * restricted to users with admin privileges, as identified via bearer token
   * JWT authentication. Upon successful creation, the endpoint returns the
   * full school record with a unique school ID, time of creation, and all
   * submitted fields. Validation errors, such as duplicate school
   * name/address or missing required fields, yield appropriate error
   * responses. This operation is critical for onboarding new institutions
   * into the platform and creating the reference anchor for related entities
   * such as teachers, students, admins, and classrooms. It should be used
   * before registering users or classes for new schools.
