   * attendance_notification_channel table. The request body contains required
   * atomic fields: student_id, channel_type (such as app_push, sms, email),
   * is_enabled boolean, and preference_order integer; parent_id may be set if
   * a guardian profile is being created or updated. All provided FKs are
   * validated for existence/ownership, and a unique constraint on
   * (student_id, parent_id, channel_type) is enforced. Typical use cases
   * include new account onboarding (auto-create app/SMS), parent granting SMS
   * authorization, or school administrator provisioning default contact
   * routes. Errors returned include privilege errors (for users trying to
   * create channels for others), invalid FKs, or uniqueness violations. On
   * success, the fully normalized channel entry is returned for immediate use
   * in settings UIs or confirmation modals.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Atomic parameters for channel creation (association, type,
   *   enable, order).

   *
   * This API retrieves a list of notification channel configurations as
   * stored in attendance_notification_channel for a user's accessible scope

   * children's channels for parent). The client may supply search parameters

   * channel records contain only normalized atomic data (presented ID fields

   * The endpoint strictly limits access to only authorized records based on
   * the role and authenticated user. Used for profile and delivery settings
   * UIs, troubleshooting notification issues, and bulk analytics. Returns
   * standard page metadata (total count, current page, total pages, etc.) and
