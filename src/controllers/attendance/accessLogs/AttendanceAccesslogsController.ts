   * Insert a new access log event (attendance_access_log table).

   * This endpoint allows the attendance system (or admins/tools) to create an
   * explicit access log event. Typical use cases include logging dashboard
   * accesses, sensitive data views, or user/session activities in compliance
   * with audit policy. Required parameters include user/account (teacher_id,
   * student_id, etc.), classroom (if applicable), ip address, user agent,
   * device id, and exact event timestamp. Audit requirements mandate that all
   * accesses of sensitive data or system pages be logged and immutable. This
   * API creates a single record in attendance_access_log and returns
   * confirmation or error as appropriate. The table is append-only for audit
   * integrity. Only system actors or applications with auditor/admin rights
   * should have write access. Related endpoints: patch for search, get for
   * detail, put for update, delete for removal.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Information for the new access log event (user/session,
   *   context, device info).

   * Search and paginate attendance access logs (attendance_access_log table).
   *
   * This API allows authorized users (typically administrators or auditors)
   * to search and retrieve a paginated list of access log entries, each
   * representing a single access event to the attendance system. Filters can
   * include user role (teacher, student, admin, parent), date intervals,
   * classroom, IP address, and other log attributes. The
   * attendance_access_log table records who accessed what, from where (user
   * agent, IP), and when. This is critical for operational monitoring,
   * security audits, and legal compliance. Result pagination, sorting, and
   * advanced search are supported for efficient log review. Related endpoints
   * include access log detail/retrieval, creation for system actions, update,
   * and deletion. The list retrieval is a patch since complex search criteria
   * can be submitted in the request body.
