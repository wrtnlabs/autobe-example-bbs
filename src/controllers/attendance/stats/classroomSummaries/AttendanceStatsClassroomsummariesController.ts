   * school, and period.
   *
   * Only admins or teachers with privileges for the target classroom are

   * (classroom_id, period_start, period_end)), and ensures that the
   * referenced classroom and school exist. Audit logs are generated
   * automatically to record the creation for compliance.
   *
   * Field validation is performed for period range, counts, and primary key
   * uniqueness. Endpoint returns the full created summary statistics row,

   * Supports advanced dashboard and reporting use cases: API clients may

   * in the request body. Only authorized admin or teacher users can query

   * allowed range of classroom/periods. If the request body is absent or

   * dashboards or exporting to CSV as per admin/teacher requirements.
