   * Permission is limited to authorized roles (typically admins or teachers).
   * It strictly follows the database's 3NF policy, ensuring that no derived

   * reference the audit policy, meaning changes must be tracked by audit logs
   * for compliance and traceability.

   * Validation ensures the target student exists, the period is valid, and
   * all summary data (such as present, late, absent, early_leave counts)
   * adheres to integrity rules. The system rejects updates that would create
   * duplicate (student_id, period_start, period_end) records. If the summary
   * statistics need to be recalculated (e.g., after correcting individual
   * records), this endpoint also refreshes the total fields.

   * near-real time. If the update leads to any abnormal pattern detected,
   * relevant hooks for abnormal log insertion are triggered.
